Dear Access to Information Officer,

  

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research examining policy alignment with the Commission's "targeted poverty alleviation" mandate.

- Supervisor: Dr. Simon Wang
    
- Purpose: Analyzing energy policy effectiveness in supporting vulnerable populations
    

  

Information Requested:

  

1. Policy Alignment Assessment: Has the Commission evaluated whether the universal ECRS design aligns with the "targeted poverty alleviation" strategy? Any internal assessments or recommendations?
    
2. Energy Poverty Recognition: Does the Commission recognize "energy poverty" as a distinct form of deprivation requiring targeted intervention? Any policy papers or position statements?
    
3. Coordination Mechanisms: What coordination exists between the Commission and EEB regarding energy policies' impact on vulnerable populations?
    
4. Best Practices: Has the Commission identified international best practices in targeted energy subsidies that could inform Hong Kong policy?

Thank you for supporting research aligned with Commission objectives.

  

Sincerely, Md Tanvir Nur Rakan
