Thank you for your email dated 6 October 2025.

Please note that the energy expenditure by subdivided units is not available.  For the household energy consumption by income group, please refer to the statistical table of "Average monthly household expenditure by broad monthly household income group by section of commodity/service by type of housing, October 2019 to September 2020".  You may refer to the section "Electricity, gas and water" for the expenditure on energy.  Kindly note that a further breakdown into "Electricity," "Gas," and "Water" is not available.

_[See attachment "S35BI_Avg_exp_sect_binc_lqtype_1920.xlsx"]_

The data source for the above statistical table is the Household Expenditure Survey (HES).  HES is conducted once every 5 years to collect up-to-date information on the expenditure patterns of households in Hong Kong.  The HES data are important inputs for updating the expenditure weights of consumer goods and services used in compiling the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The 2019/20 HES was conducted from October 2019 to September 2020, during which consumption pattern was severely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic.

Should you have any further queries on the HES, please feel free to contact our Price Research and Analytics Section (2) (Tel. no. : (852) 3903 7384, E-mail : [hes@censtatd.gov.hk](mailto:hes@censtatd.gov.hk "mailto:hes@censtatd.gov.hk")).
