# URGENT: Government Enquiry Letter Revision (48-Hour Action Plan)

## STRATEGIC APPROACH: DEPARTMENT-SPECIFIC ENQUIRIES

### **CRITICAL FIXES FOR ALL LETTERS**
1. **Remove all advocacy language** - delete "ineffective and unjust," "catastrophe," "urge the government"
2. **Fix factual error** - change to correct HK$1,200 figure (HK$50/month over 24 months)
3. **Use department-specific expertise** - tailor questions to each unit's mandate
