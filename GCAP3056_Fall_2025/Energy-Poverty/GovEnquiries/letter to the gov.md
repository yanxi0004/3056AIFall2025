Dear Access to Information Officer,

  

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

  

Student Details:

Name: Md Tanvir Nur Rakan

University: Hong Kong Baptist University 

Course: GCAP3056

Project Title: Inequality in the government electricity subsidy scheme 

  

Information Requested:

1. What government department has historical records on the design and rationale for the energy subsidy (amount, duration, and eligibility)?

2. Can you provide official documents or meeting minutes detailing the decision-making process that led to the current energy subsidy amount and duration changes (from HK$1800 to HK$1200 over 24 months)?

3. Is there survey data collected by the government tracking household energy consumption by income bracket? If so, where is this data published?

  
  

Purpose: This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to this particular problem we are working on.

Hong Kong's universal electricity subsidy policy is ineffective and unjust. 210,000 energy-poor households face a catastrophe, having to pick between basic requirements while receiving the same token subsidy as wealthier households. The main flaw is that the subsidy ignores inequality; it frequently fails to reach tenants in subdivided apartments since the payment is sent to the landlord's account. This neglect has an impact on health, dignity, and social mobility. Thus, we urge the government to legally identify energy poverty and replace the general program with tailored support for vulnerable families. 

Meanwhile, the initial subsidy of HK$1,800 has been reduced to HK$1,000. This is also a concern for low-income households.

  
  
  

Timeframe: If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

  

Thank you for your assistance with our research.
