A few comments on the draft /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/ObSync/Vault4sync/GCAP3056/Energy-Poverty/LettersARParguments/draft ARP energy poverty.md

it is quite long and there is no headings and sub-headings- not easy for readers to understand

we should add headings and sub-headings

it is still early to write ARP

we should work on an outline first and discuss how to improve the outline and do more research

rushing through the actual write up of the ARP is premature and counterproductive to learning in this course

we need to clarify on how we do this project

we begin with a plan on how to write the ARP and the SCMP letter

then we do research to gather publicly available info about the topic

based on the info we gather and the outline

we identify gap in information and write an email enquiry to the government

regarding info gathering I only see a page /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/ObSync/Vault4sync/GCAP3056/Energy-Poverty/PublicInfo/infoGathered.md we need to not just list the URLs; we have to read the docs and take notes

through note taking and processing the info we gather, we can then identify the info gap

also we had meetings before there were otter notes- team members should read the notes and write summaries on the notes

here are a few things that AI has done for the team
