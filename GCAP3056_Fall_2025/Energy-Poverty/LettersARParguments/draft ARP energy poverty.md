ARGUMENTATIVE RESEARCH PAPER

  

To address the growing impacts of socioeconomic dynamics and the environment, the HKSAR government launched the Energy Charges Subsidy Scheme. The Energy Charges Subsidy Scheme was first launched in 2008 to provide direct relief to household electricity expenses by subsidising the accounts of residents managed by the city's power corporations. The government, in the most recent iteration in 2022, offered a one-off, no-application-required, direct grant of HK$ 1,000 which was distributed monthly to residential electricity accounts (The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 2022). This policy streamlined relief on electricity expenses during a time of rapid inflation and global gas-price rises, helping to ensure social order and security. This is, however, a short-term relief measure, which is ineffective in providing long-term solutions and accomplishing the objectives of incentivising conservation, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and encouraging the use of alternative energy sources. Providing subsidies regardless of a household's energy use activities weakens the intent of the policy and nurtures practices of inefficient energy use.The government has an obligation to apply sustainable practices to their revision of the subsidy, for example, introducing vertically differentiated subsidies to reward low-consumption households, or subsidies provided upon the installation of energy-efficient devices. Such revisions preserve the role of subsidies in economically relieving the burden, while encouraging the energy user to adopt responsible practices to energy consumption. For this reason, revising the Energy Charges Subsidy Scheme will provide the balancing measure necessary for economically unsustainable development in Hong Kong to evolve into sustainable development.

  

This paper discusses the conflict between the current implementation status and the expected objectives of Hong Kong's energy policy. Under Hong Kong's existing Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme, the program categorizes residents simply into households requiring subsidies and those not requiring subsidies. For households requiring subsidies, the scheme provides an annual electricity subsidy totaling 1,000 HKD. However, after an in-depth examination of Hong Kong's electricity subsidy framework, this paper concludes that the subsidy program does not truly meet the needs of Hong Kong citizens. The Hong Kong Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme indicates that registered residential electricity users are generally eligible for electricity bill subsidies. As it said, as a universal subsidy policy, every household in Hong Kong can easily obtain the subsidy. However, in Hong Kong where income disparities exist, subsidy programs that lack targeted assistance fail to meet the needs of impoverished families requiring support, instead resulting in wasteful expenditure of government funds. For example, wealthier households not only have the ability to afford electricity bills, but they can also purchase high-efficiency appliances, which enable them to achieve significantly higher electricity utilization efficiency compared to energy-poor households. For energy-poor households, providing electricity subsidies alone does not fundamentally alter their energy poverty. Their energy utilization efficiency remains significantly lower than those of wealthier households. Therefore, this paper argues that Hong Kong's current electricity subsidy scheme does not meet the genuine needs of its residents and should be improved. 

  

 The Electricity Charge Relief Scheme (ECRS) had its bill passed in 2008/2009 by the financial secretary the Hon John C Tsang. It was a direct approach to address the critical issue at that time which was mentioned in the first part of the bill. In his speech he mentioned “To ease inflationary pressure” which shows how forward Hong Kong government’s approach was to assist the household to offset their electrical expenses. Two power companies were also mentioned; CLP power and HK Electric who are the parent companies where the government subsidy was credited. 

Some of the key features of this plan was its very general approach. It had a criterion which covered a vast majority of the population. First of all, the subsidy was only given to registered electricity account holders. Anyone living off illegally or not on government record would not receive the subsidy. These subsidies after the announcement of the bill were automatically credited to resident’s accounts. Thus, there was no need to apply separately. Secondly, this subsidy had no restriction or maximum requirements. Which means the income or assets, employment did not matter to the eligibility of ECRS. Whether the household is marked as a low- or high-income household it received the same flat rate subsidy. 

The policy was made targeting several objectives. Primarily it was to directly aid the residents for the inflation. By covering a substantial amount of the electric bill, it was easier for the public to invest their income in more productive ways. It increasingly helps the effectiveness of disposable family income. But if we look deep into the situation, we can relate this to the fact that Hong Kong is a very expensive city. The high cost of living can be taking the lion share of someone’s income. By providing such schemes the government allows the residents to cover up other bills and helps cushion the impact of these necessities. 

Additionally, this scheme did not need to create an extra system. The government used the existing system to distribute the funds as quickly as possible. This means the residents did not need to register separately allowing minimal administrative cost and effort.  

While the scheme has its primary target it also contributes to the poverty reduction whether its energy or overall poverty. The progressive nature and constant update of the subsidy allows the government to modify the scheme compared in the fiscal year. The subsidy allows families to spend their earnings on improving their livelihood. For low or middle income houses it’s a relief as they can better manage their household expenditure in an expensive city like Hong Kong. The stealth nature of the scheme shows that the amount whether it's $1800 or $1000 is not making a difference to high income households as such amount is a small discount for the family and it's just a small part of their overall earning. But for a low-income house such money is significant. 

  
Additionally, the subsidy impacts directly to the energy price in a low-income household. The houses that are on the brink of energy poverty this amount covers a generous amount of their energy bill. This prevents an elderly person from choosing his health such as AC in summer over the stress of unhealthful saving. This makes them less likely to choose between the two. On the other hand, the scheme being automatic and universal means it will be available to everyone. Which eliminates problems such as lack of awareness, social stigma, and targeted welfare. 

The simplicity and the universality of this scheme makes it look like a pragmatic approach but this scheme comes with its own flaws too. Behind this scheme lies a well-planned social welfare policy. We can see this by the inconsistency of the subsidy amount and having no economical calculation or formula to draw such an amount. The ECRS is temporary and depends on the annual government budget. The subsidy effectively used as an easy way out of disastrous cases such as the pandemic. It’s often used to gain support from the government as this subsidy is a quick-relief. This makes this plan fragile and unreliable in the long run. The policy is more reactive to the economic or political conditions rather than proactive based on the assessment of energy poverty of Hong Kong. For high income houses it might not be enough all the time. And for middle class houses it's just a relief covering the payments of some months. But the problem is often very visible in low-income houses, mostly the subdivided flats. As the subsidy is credited to the landlord's account and there is no legal requirement for the landlord to be passing all the amount to its tenants.

  

In recent times, this ECRs scheme is still applicable and is elemental support for the underprivileged in Hong Kong. In current times the ECRS under the scheme of CLP power offers a mere amount of 50$ per month. This small sum, a remnant of outdated fiscal policy, does nothing to tackle the growing energy poverty in the city. While this measure has been consistent over the years since 2008, it falls short of the measures that the citizens of Hong Kong need considering the sky rocketing cost of living. This measure with all the flaws that come along barely even scratches the surface of the financial stress that low income households in Hong Kong face. Along the same timeline as the ECRs there were several other energy schemes that were also placed by the government and CLP to help the people make energy more affordable for them along with energy efficiency. One of them was MEELs also known as the Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling scheme which focused on upgrading the technology in order to promote efficiency rather than providing direct financial support and for those who can not afford this upgrade, these initiatives simply make no difference for them.

  

After reading the recent budget guidelines by the government of Hong Kong, the omission of ECRs from the budget clearly shows the intention of the government when it comes to energy poverty. Inflation has been persistent in Hong Kong and as

ECRs was previously a relief for the people of the city, the policy is still stuck in the 2008 timeline where energy subsidies are treated as small adjustments to the cost of living instead of being a vital tool for energy welfare and equity. What was initially an 1800$ boost has faded into ongoing drip leaving the low income household struggling with the rising energy costs and consumption necessity. As another notable effort by the CLP power has allocated HK$50 million from the CLP community Energy Saving Funds to the CLP Energy subsidies for the low income households and underprivileged Families Programme. Under this program HK$600 are given as a subsidy to 50,000 aged 65 or above either elderly singleton or elderly doubleton, low income families and people either with disabilities as well as energy subsidy of 1000$ to 20,000 tenants of subdivided units in its supply area. But it is to be noted that CLP takes its support from the NGOs rather than the government.

  

However if we look at a data comparison in the residential sector alone between the year 2011 to year 2023 the energy consumption has increased to 7864 terajoules. According to the data from the Hong Kong poverty situation report in 2020  many poor households rely on the direct payment in kind for water, electricity and gas bills from non household members which shows that energy costs are a significant burden for these households. Until the government of Hong Kong revises the energy ECRs or prioritizes a more meaningful energy welfare system, this fight against energy poverty will keep going and due to the lack of critical factors that truly help the low income households there will be only very little that this existing scheme can do. This calls the government to revise the scheme in order to help.

  

Going ahead, Hong Kong’s government should consider revising the ECRs with a different intention from the past, focusing more on the sustainability and equity results of this scheme. That could directly include targeted subsidy to the low income households and incentivizing energy efficient strategy. A reimagined energy welfare system is arguably essential to the alleviate economic burdens but also to encourage the households to adopt sustainable energy practices ensuring a fairer and sustainable future for the all those residing in Hong Kong**
