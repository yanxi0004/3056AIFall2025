## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY - LESSON LEARNED

### **❌ What We Did Wrong (Weeks 1-5)**
1. **Premature Writing**: Rushed into ARP drafting without proper outline
2. **Insufficient Research**: Listed URLs without reading and taking notes
3. **Poor Documentation**: No tracking of individual contributions
4. **Lack of Structure**: No headings/subheadings in draft ARP

### **✅ Correct Approach Going Forward**
1. **Plan First**: Work on outline before writing
2. **Research Thoroughly**: Read all sources and take detailed notes
3. **Identify Gaps**: Use research to find information needs
4. **Government Enquiry**: Target specific departments for missing data
5. **Document Everything**: Track individual contributions weekly
6. **Team Collaboration**: Regular communication and shared accountability

---

## INFORMATION GAPS IDENTIFIED

### **🔍 Critical Data Needs**
1. **Historical Context**: 2007-2008 Legislative Council documents on ECRS origins
2. **Administrative Costs**: Current ECRS implementation expenses
3. **Vulnerable Populations**: Subdivided unit tenant access data
4. **Energy Consumption**: Household usage patterns by income level
5. **Policy Integration**: ECRS-MEELS coordination opportunities

### **📈 Research Strategy**
- **Government Sources**: Department-specific enquiries
- **Academic Sources**: International best practices research
- **Expert Interviews**: Policy analysts and NGO representatives
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical correlation between energy and poverty

## KEY ARGUMENTS FRAMEWORK

### **🎯 Main Thesis**
Hong Kong's universal Electricity Charges Relief Scheme (ECRS) contradicts the government's stated "targeted poverty alleviation" strategy and should be reformed into an efficiency-promoting, targeted system.

### **🏗️ Supporting Arguments**
1. **Policy Inconsistency**: ECRS universal approach vs. Commission on Poverty targeting mandate
2. **Ineffective Targeting**: High-income households receive same subsidy as energy-poor families
3. **Missed Opportunities**: No integration with energy efficiency programs (MEELS)
4. **Administrative Inefficiency**: Complex delivery system vs. simpler alternatives
5. **Subdivided Unit Gap**: Most vulnerable populations may not receive benefits

### **💡 Reform Proposals**
1. **Tiered Subsidy System**: Income-based eligibility and amounts
2. **Efficiency Incentives**: Rebates for energy-efficient appliances
3. **Direct Tenant Support**: Address subdivided unit landlord intermediation
4. **Policy Integration**: Combine ECRS with MEELS for comprehensive approach
