Subject: GCAP3056 Energy Poverty Project - Week 5 Progress Review and Next Steps

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As we conclude Week 5 of our energy poverty project, I wanted to share some feedback on our progress and outline the critical next steps for the coming week.

FEEDBACK ON CURRENT DRAFT

I've reviewed the ARP draft you've submitted, and while I appreciate the effort, there are several important areas that need attention:

1. STRUCTURE AND READABILITY
   The current draft is quite long and lacks proper headings and sub-headings, making it difficult for readers to follow your arguments. We need to add clear section headers to improve readability and logical flow.
2. PREMATURE WRITING APPROACH
   It appears we may have rushed into the actual writing of the ARP without sufficient preparation. This approach is counterproductive to the learning objectives of this course. We should focus on developing a solid outline first, then conduct thorough research to support our arguments.

CORRECT PROJECT METHODOLOGY

Let me clarify the proper sequence for this project:

1. Begin with a comprehensive plan for both the ARP and SCMP letter
2. Conduct thorough research to gather publicly available information
3. Based on the information gathered and our outline, identify gaps in available data
4. Write targeted email enquiries to government departments for missing information

RESEARCH CONCERNS

I've noticed that while you've collected URLs in the infoGathered.md file, there's insufficient evidence of actually reading these documents and taking detailed notes. Simply listing URLs is not adequate - you must read the documents, extract relevant information, and take comprehensive notes to identify information gaps.

Additionally, I see that you've had team meetings with Otter transcripts available, but team members haven't been reading these notes and writing proper summaries. This is a missed opportunity for collective learning and project development.

3. REVIEW AI-GENERATED MATERIALS
   All team members must review the four Google Doc tabs listed above and provide feedback, comments, or edits where appropriate.

NEXT WEEK'S FOCUS (WEEK 6)

When we meet next week, our primary focus will be revising the ARP based on the structured outline approach. We will:

- Review the AI-generated outline and incorporate team feedback
- Address information gaps while waiting for government responses
- Implement proper project methodology going forward
- Improve team coordination and individual accountability

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Remember that this project is designed to teach you proper research methodology, policy analysis, and collaborative work skills. The process is as important as the final product. Focus on:

- Systematic research and note-taking
- Logical argument development
- Professional government correspondence
- Effective team collaboration

I encourage you to work together more effectively as a team and ensure that each member is contributing meaningfully to the project. Document your individual contributions and communicate regularly to maintain project momentum.

Please acknowledge receipt of this email and confirm your commitment to:

1. Sending the government enquiry emails within the next 48 hours
2. Reviewing all the Google Doc tabs listed above
3. Updating your individual contribution documentation

Looking forward to seeing improved progress next week.
