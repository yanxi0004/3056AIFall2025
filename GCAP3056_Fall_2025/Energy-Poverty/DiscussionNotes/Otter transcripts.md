Yeah, okay, so for this game, you know this? This game is actually very typical Hong Kong government's approach. When they got some money, they just give it to everybody without considering who actually needs it, right? Like a couple of years ago, the education bureau would give every student 3000 Hong Kong dollars or something. They don't really consider their background, you know, which is absurd. This is also similar. They just give some subsidy for every household and one immediate concern would be those who live in the subdivided units, they may not get the subsidies, right? Yeah, it could be the landlord collecting the electricity bills, the money from from the tenants, but then they got the landlord get the subsidies, so that will be a concern, and also in terms of administrative cost, right? So running this scheme could be expensive. What if, instead of giving out the subsidy, maybe you just give some tax credit, yeah? So, so tax credit, you know, but, but, but that's something we have to figure out. Whether tax credit administrative fee, or course, would be less, yeah. Then December, giving out, dispersing the subsidies, yeah? So that's kind of a technical question. It's an accounting question, because we don't know how much it would be cost for for this scheme to run. This could be a question to ask, but very likely the bureau would just say, we don't account for the course for running a separate scheme, yeah, so then we may not really have much information there, but still, if we consult some accounting professionals or some people Like doing administrative thing, we might be able to Yeah, we might be able to get some kind of answer, yeah. So that's one, one thing we could do, which is something we can see in the document, bye, bye. So, yeah, so that's where we are, I guess, in terms of energy poverty itself, um, there's also a little bit like document talking about case studies. I found a couple of research conducted as well in last couple of years, right Energy Power team, right going in their multi dimensional analysis for energy poverty. So I'm I'm going through that right now, so I think we can focus. I think the main focus that I was aiming for was to to see if their energy policies for sustainability are efficient, and if they're not efficient, what are the ways that they can become efficient? Because I think if we collect, if we ask for the data for their existing policies, especially Mel, and then there's another policy they had, let me put the name, because I think that's the only like, that's a very big loophole in their system for energy efficiency, because energy in general in Hong Kong is pretty cheap. Like, it's not too expensive, yeah, so I think to but it's still expensive enough for low income households at the same time. Yeah, so actually, I'm just thinking, you know, poverty is obviously a more familiar concept, but when it comes to energy poverty, what? Does it mean, and what are some of the implications when we assign this label to certain group of people and when they say they suffer from energy poverty? So I think that that might be something maybe you can give us a mini lecture on this because, because I'm not very familiar with so basically, energy poverty is the concept of poverty carried forward, but in terms of energy, so in In layman terms, energy poverty would mean that you don't have good access to energy, right? You're poor to afford energy, right? Energy is not efficient in your house. It's not available in your house because you're poor in terms of energy, and the policies given by the government are very generalized. So let's say I am a high income household and someone is a low income household. Both can't use the same electrical appliances because one high efficiency air conditioner, and let's say a low energy efficient air conditioner, there will be separate price differences. I can afford it because I live in a high household, in high income household, but the other person who has a low income household, he cannot afford the same technology as me. So here is the generalized line of poverty between two households. Now, if we look deeper into it, the both the houses are consuming the energy, electricity from the government, and the government is giving a subsidy for everyone in a generalized manner. So whatever I am getting that other person is getting as well. But with me, I can work because I have a very high end tech that can reduce energy reduce energy costs, and the other person who doesn't have the high end machine, can't use the same money. It's like I am using 10 Hong Kong dollar to buy a bread, but you can use the one USD to buy the same bread. So again, you know, in order to distinguish energy poverty from poverty in general, we want to focus on not just the general like low income or the lack of financial resources, but the lack of access to could be infrastructure. I think energy poverty, if we consider the factors that account for energy poverty, that includes electricity appliances that are being used by the household, that considers infrastructure, that considers the material of the building as that falls under infrastructure that sometimes for some studies, they also consider the education levels, because if you're not educated Enough, you won't know how to be energy efficient. Okay? Well, that's different. That doesn't fall under energy poverty. That's a by product. But your point about limited access to more efficient appliances, because I was actually looking at does that? There's a department, they actually got a labeling system. Yeah, yeah. So, so presumably, the more efficient appliances could be a bit more expensive. They're a lot more expensive, right? But their energy costing would be a lot cheaper in the long term, in long term, right? So far, for example, let's say if me el approved air conditioner is being used in the house, right? And then there is a normal, I don't know, let's say they give me a brand of air conditioner, a Panasonic, I don't know, yeah, or LG, yeah, air conditioning is being used. The cost and the electricity bill would be way higher for that LG air conditioning than the MEL approved air conditioning because those are built in a way to be inverters, which are to be sustainable and energy efficient, but take low energy and their output is still the same. Okay, so I guess one one direction to make the argument would be, we should propose that the government choose Modify or revamp the current subsidy scheme, instead of giving everybody indiscriminately, you know, whatever, because, frankly speaking, for the high income household, this whatever amount is just not so important, right? It doesn't make any difference. But this money, it can be more targeted, right? And not just to subsidize the electricity bill, but to invest on infrastructure, provide subsidies for them to buy or replace the appliances with more more efficient version or models, then that can be another way to alleviate energy. Another issue that falls under this place is the eligibility for them, because there is a replacement feature that government offers. I don't know which department it is okay so there is youth can basically submit your previous it's called CLP, receive subsidy for energy efficient equipment. Ah, but, but let's run by Is it the government or is the wait? Let me check if it's wrong. I think air conditioner, it is supported by the government, that I'm sure. I don't know if it's electrical equipment upgrade scheme, yeah, community, energy saving fund program, list, government, right, but the problem that falls under this this is that there are a lot of eligibility problems. Not everybody would be eligible for this okay, because not every project from previous buildings would be eligible for this scheme, right? So then we come back to the same problem at the end of the day, right? That, how are we addressing the low income households? Okay? Well, I think it would make sense to run the number, because essentially, what we need to do is to propose kind of a different version of the reality, right? We have, we have a version of the current reality, which is the government devoted a large amount of money, and it's being distributed to every household for for electricity subsidies. But then the alternative way to spend the money is to maybe expand some of the existing like electrical equipment upgrade scheme, but then, if you want to propose that, we have to collect some data about the current cost of the scheme, how many people benefited from the same scheme, and how Many people are excluded because of whatever eligibility rules, and then you run the number and say, Look, if we only got a proportion of the money from the subsidy scheme and to invest in a different scheme, then the outcome would be very different. So I think that's better than just say, oh, we should take away this money to help, because now we have an existing framework, existing program to work on. That means we're not start from scratch. Yeah, that's always better than just say, you know, transfer the money or whatever. Yeah. So, so that means there will be the two programs to investigate. One is the existing subsidy program. We can still do a little bit estimation, like, but we have to start thinking about how to tell the story, like, among all the households, like, how many are paying out, like, a lot of tax or something, anyone who pay a lot of tax, then this money is, it's not really, I think you can set the line from the statistical department right, see what under what falls under poverty line, right? Percentage of houses fall into poverty line, because that's what I was doing before. And I think, according to their data, 22% fall under low income households because of the infrastructure and the salaries. There were the two major factors that were considered. So maybe we can what we can do is we can consider these two elements to define that these people are more deserving of that money. So the allocation of subsidies could be altered in a way that the eligibility depends on the infrastructure of the house and the material of the house right. See, the thing is, we have to look a bit closer about the original intention and motivation of the subsidy scheme. Yeah, because I don't know whether we may be able to locate such document like this, this whatever Bureau, maybe they apply for the fund, they submitted some document to the Legislative Council. Maybe in that document we can see their original intention. So I suspect when they set up the scheme in the first place, their intention is not just to reduce poverty. There could be some other intention, the sustainability, could be another. The sustainability ESG, becoming green, yeah, becoming green. And it could be, I don't know. You know, you know, it could be the power, the power zero carbon policy. Oh, the power company has got some profit to share. You see, I mean, so because, because we, we cannot simply say, you know, the money should all go to the poor people, because that, that argument probably won't work, which is why we have to go back to the original document. Or we could, we could ask them, yeah, we could ask the bureau and say, you know, what was the intention? What was the intention or motivation of having this scheme in the first place? Yeah, and that argument about cost effectiveness is definitely something we should pursue. I mean, if, if it is possible to replace the scheme with tax credit, you see, I mean, then it would be, probably more cost efficient, and then whatever money saved, plus the proportion that, you know, just, just do a little bit kind of adjustment or something, or revamp the scheme, and then more money will be available, and then we can start looking at the upgrades of equipment. But again, it's it's about. We need to start running some numbers, right? Because with with the quantitative data, you know, the argument would become more convincing. I so I think for our first approach, it should be to ask the Bureau for why, yeah, why the scheme was first, right? Because, because the scheme has been around for quite some years and quite a big amount of money, you know, it went, went back to 208, 14,000 we need to know the intention of this game, the CLP or the Mel, both, both. Okay, CLP is private, right? No, government. CLP is, CLP is the, is the private company but, but it's the subsidy scheme with them for changing is partnered with government. Oh, yeah, no. Company is private, yeah, the electricity charge subsidy scheme, it's, yeah, it's been around for nearly two decade, two decades, yeah, or 15 years, more than 15 years. So yeah, you, you have to go back to the Legislative Council document in 207 probably in order to find that, if you can locate that document in the document, there must be some explanation or rationale of starting This scheme in the first place. Can you need to you need to, I think it's probably on the Legislative Council website. In fact, you can even try email the secretary of the Legislative Council and see, but do some research first, just search for this scheme in the Legislative Concept. I'm sure that there will be document all this so, but I guess energy so how can can energy poverty be linked to, like transition? Of Energy Transition and climate change. Yes, yeah. So how does that link work? Due to climate change, the energy consumption changes, for example, heat waves get higher or more like to use air conditioning or typhoons increase, so you're more likely to have preventative measures required for it. So energy poverty does link to climate change, but the aspect that I was hoping to look of energy poverty, in this case, was more linked towards sustainable approach like because energy poverty and sustainability kind of can go together. So if you're being sustainable, your energy poverty kind of reduces. So instead of targeting climate change and targeting the energy policies and what can be done within the hands of the government and people to make that change. Okay, right? So another, I think there's a kind of one critical point we can make criticize this scheme, is that this is something we mentioned earlier that some of the poor households may not be able to benefit from, but that's a that's kind of like a minor. Well, it's not minor for them, but it will be a part of it. Yes. Okay, so it seems like we do have, we do have a good plan right moving forward. So I think the next step is hopefully, by next Thursday, you will have a email sent, sent off to to the government and including about this scheme. And then there's the other scheme upgrade. Do you do is, do you, do you think we should do it by, like, next week, or should we do it next like, during the class next week? Well, actually, I would prefer you send it off before the meeting. Yeah, because in a meeting we can talk about something else. That means you need to prepare the questions, hopefully over the weekend, and we I review it, and then you send it over, like, next Monday or Tuesday. Sounds good? Yeah, I will share the questions that we come up with. Then, like, I will share the email to you. You can check if you think there are any more ideas. We could put in any changes we can Yep, and then we can go from there. Okay, any other questions. I think the energy poverty as a concept and as a concern as a social concern, is probably not as well. It's obviously not as familiar as poverty itself. So we just need to think about how to like in only one sentence or two to explain it. One thing I need to remind you is that I actually set up an outline for the argument research paper, so you can take a look, and you can start thinking about how to how you write it, okay? Because that can actually help you to decide what question you want to raise for the government, right? And also, in terms of letter to the editor, there's some draft. It's just for your reference. You can decide maybe, you know, sometimes there could be a good opportunity for you to write a letter. Usually it's when the when the budget was announced by the financial secretary. There could be a session about that, yeah, and then you can write a response. So that could be a good but that's usually when, when, usually, the budget is released. It's October, right? It's probably October. When was this? Yeah, so, so October, but then that's already Oh, October, late February. Each year, late February. Okay, yeah, from April to March, 31 so aligning, yeah, so yeah. Then you can, you can keep this letter draft and send it next February. But, but, you know, sometimes there will be other opportunity, yeah and, and even, even you don't, you don't always have to respond to a current event, yeah, but, but I think the editors these days would prefer current the letter is linked to the current event to some extent. Yes, I.

Uh, yeah, so, so basically, I think what we're going to do is maybe we can just brainstorm a little bit and come up with an outline for the argumentative research paper and the letter. Usually the letter and argument paper would share the same structure, the same outline, but ARP would be a kind of a longer version, more elaborate version, that will be sent to the to the lawmakers, but the letter will be for the newspaper, and usually it's only about, you know, 200 to 300 words. Okay, so perhaps we want to just kind of come up with something. So one thing we have to decide is whether we start with the subsidy scheme or start with the poverty situation. So so these are the two, two different options. If we start with the subsidies scheme, then we we're going to just say, okay, so this is, this is a scheme that has been around for for many years. It was introduced, introduced in 208, and we start looking at its original, original intention. We look at the Legislative Council document at the time, why people, why the government developed a scheme in the first place. And we want to focus on this intention, which is to ease the inflationary pressure, right? So we want to maybe offer our interpretation of this, this, this intention. So we would argue that implicitly, this should be aligned with poverty reduction, because the inflationary pressure would affect people, you know from kind of low income families, this disproportionately more, right? So, so, so, so, in other words, we want to, so let's say, introduce the subsidy scheme first. Launched a bit of info ledger, ability and amount, and then focus on its intention and objective, and From peace inflationary pressure to poverty reduction, right? So, so in terms of if this is the introduction, so this is the introduction, and this could be where we actually make the claim, right? So there will be our main argument, which is this subsidy scheme should be revised to fight energy poverty or something like that, right? So, so that will be, that will be kind of the opening paragraph. We provide the background information, we introduce the subsidy scheme, and we talk a little bit about its objective intention, original intention. And then we try to reframe the discussion from simply a general subsidy scheme for everybody, the general public, to our our goal, our agenda, which is, yeah, energy, poverty reduction now, then we need to start getting into the details. So well, this is where we can we can brainstorm a little bit more. So what, what do you think? What would you what do you think we should write next?

I think we can take like apart from the energy subsidies, we can also outline the other policies that government added to help with the energy poverty, like, for example, the Mels and the cop. And then we can talk about the flaws that they have.

Hold on. You talk about CLP, right? What CLP is, commission on poverty. What was the other thing that you talk about me?

L, it's mandatory efficiency, energy efficiency

labeling scheme, okay, can you send that? Can you edit here? Just put, put the link here. So, yeah, of course. Um, yeah, I remember we were talking about this, this labeling scheme,

okay, and then we can Talk about, what are the problems with these schemes, and then maybe we can do an elaborative solution on all the problems that we've listed

out, right? Can you put the link here so I can? Yeah, I already did. I already did. I think, okay, great, okay, so, um, but the thing is, with this particular label, this label has nothing to do. It's not directly linked to energy poverty, right?

It's somewhat linked because this is also one of the schemes that basically helps make energy cheaper for people, right?

But I think the original objectives or intention of the scheme is more about energy efficiency and to benefit the general public, right? Yeah, okay, I think we have to be, we need to be a little bit strategic and try to weave this different schemes together. Because, you see, we got several different themes or plot, if you will, in our letters. So how can we, you know, weave all these themes or props together into a coherent story without confusing people? And we need to be more careful here. So that makes me think maybe we should begin our letter with the concept of energy poverty, okay, yeah, I think that's fair, because, after all, that's our primary concern. So so maybe we can start with something like or we can. We can begin with the we can. We can talk a little bit about the general picture of energy reduction in Hong Kong and a little bit of work, a little bit on the work that has been done by the Commission on poverty and the current administration. Maybe you need, we need to check the policy address 2025 and see. Let me see. Let's see. Oh, I'm sorry, yeah,

if we really talk about the actual poverty, then bring that part in. Will that make the article way too big? Will that be a problem?

Or wait, we could also exclude the energy poverty element. And could connect energy and poverty as two separate entities that are correlated, if that makes sense.

Well, actually, going back to to your concern about the length the word count, I think it can be quite concise, right? So it's like we begin with talking about energy poverty in general, but then very quickly we're going to narrow our focus, or shift our focus to energy poverty. Because I think energy poverty is a concept that if you talk to people about it a little bit, it will be quite easy for them to understand, but the concept itself may not be very, very common or familiar to the readership. So that's why I'm thinking we can just that, that could become a novelty, right? Kind of a make our letter a bit more refreshing for the readership. So, yeah. I mean, yeah, so. But the thing is, the starting point should be still talking about the current administration, the current government's attempts to alleviate poverty. Because, as you can see here, they do have, they do have this, you know, some attempt so. So, in other words, the thing is, because policy address has just been released recently, so even, like early next month, if we submit the letter, we can still refer to this policy address. It's still kind of within the news cycle you send me. So, yeah. So, so that will be like shifting from general poverty alleviation of the government to energy poverty, which is going to be the focus, and then that's the problem is to try to solve, right? So somehow, just just seeing a few words, you know, up to four or five sentences a paragraph, we're going to narrow the focus to energy poverty, and then the next, the next paragraph, we will start looking at, we're going to start looking at the substance subsidy scheme, and we can talk about it. You know how the tension is to ease inflationary pressure. But we believe, you know, focusing on a specific group of people with more financial needs and provide more subsidy to them would be, would better, can will help the government to achieve their goals. So, so this is where we can start. You know, proposing, basically how revising the scheme can help the government to alleviate energy poverty, which is the focus that we introduced in the previous paragraph. And after, after talking about that, we then move on to talk about that energy efficiency scheme, right? Because then we can use this as a case study, and to say this is a great scheme, you know, it's, it's, it's, it provides the clear information for consumers to make the right decisions to basically achieve energy efficiency and also make energy cheaper. Yeah, but, but, you know, the poor people, then we tie this back to energy poverty and say, but the poor people would find it more difficult to actually benefit from the scheme because of the prices, and, you know, the initial commitment or investment that's required for for to benefit from the scheme. So so that would become kind of like a related argument would be, if, if we revise the scheme, and we save some money from subsidizing the rich or middle class, and that money can be used to not just to pay the, you know, subsidized electricity bill, but also set up a separate scheme, or sub scheme under this energy efficiency labeling scheme that would allow the poor people to benefit further and that will become a more targeted poverty reduction efforts, which is actually something I think the government is trying to do. If you look at the Commission on poverty, it says, it says, to implement various targeted poverty of the alleviation projects. So, so you see the keywords targeted would would be very important, because that means we don't just kind of splash out for cash or money to the general poverty problem, but we're looking at more specific concerns and also looking at the specific groups of people who needs help, so that that would become kind of One of the driving forces, or sort of the, the theme, the underlying principles for our for our argument, you know, because the government is trying to be targeted, and our argument is also that we should be targeted, and to target energy poverty would be Our, our argument here. Okay, okay, does it make sense? So I guess, you know, we kind of have a pretty good outline for the matter now, right? So, so, so we start with poverty reduction to energy poverty reduction, and then we talk about the subsidy scheme, and then we move on to talk about labeling scheme as a as a possible, you know, a better way to spend the money that that can be saved. And, yeah, so, so. And then the last paragraph, it could be just a call for action. And if, if possible, we could maybe either echo some points from the policy address, or it could be, you know, talk a little bit about climate change as well, right? So, yeah, so, so I think, I think that that should work, maybe because after you, when you, when you get the recording and transfer, you take some notes. We should have a more kind of detailed letter outline. And based on that, you can then we can then think about, what are the question we should ask the government, right? Yeah. So what do you think?

Then I think, what do you recommend? Should we start writing the argumentative because I think if we start writing it, it will give us a lot of direction and bring up more questions. Then, yeah,

I would say the argumentative research paper would be following the more or less the same structure as the letter. The only difference is the word count, right? As I said earlier, the letter should be, these days, we want to make it super, super concise. You know, we're talking about 250 would be, is already a pretty long letter these days, unless we have a lot of data and insights and maybe we write a longer letter, but usually we're talking about 200 to 250 and we want to be really, really concise. So that's the that's the kind of, the amount of text you have to write

for the letter argumentative research paper. What's the word count we're looking for?

It's usually 500 words per group member, yeah. So remember, yeah.

So maybe from from here and from today, we will work on the argumentative research paper, because if we start working on it, it will bring up more questions and more flaws in our discussion, and like all the topics we've discussed and all the questions that we like, gather from writing the argumentative we can put together and see if we can use that to derive information from the Government. And then once our argument, like we can simultaneously do both. And then I think for the letter, we just have to concise the argumentative. So that shouldn't be a lot of effort, right?

Okay, yeah, why don't you, why don't you just work on this a little bit more like for both letter and ARP, based on our discussion today, we can come up with a more elaborate outline, and based on the outline, and also, maybe you can also update the page here, just to, you know, go through all the documents that you have found, and then I think it will become more clear, where is The gap of information. Well, what is the kind of data that we need from from the government that can strengthen the argument? Because, from the perspective of the editor, they are always looking for letters with new ideas that's kind of interesting and novel, but, but I think, I think in our case, energy poverty is definitely something they would they would appreciate. Because actually, I think the editors, they, some of them, are coming from ethnic minority background as well. So you can see there's quite a number of letters. Either it's on ethnic minority or sometimes it's on gay and lesbian, LGBT community. So, so, so you, I think this kind of letters on poverty would be, you know, something they they would appreciate. But, yeah, so they're looking for for new ideas, but they're also looking for letters with with a lot of data and information that can support the argument. So, and sometimes, especially when the data is newsworthy, right? So, so we can find some data, and also, given the fact that we are trying to synergize different government schemes, I think, I think that's also a strength of the argument. As long as we can, we can make a convincing case, right? So, so whatever we're saying here actually makes sense. It's, it sounds, you know, feasible, or at least plausible, then I think, I think we're waiting. I think we are going to be have a very, very good shot, a very good opportunity to get something published, yeah, so I hope that's that's useful, and you will be able to move on. And again, I think in terms of a timeline, ideally you should be able to send a request to the government by by this week, within this week, but if you need to work on it a bit more over the weekend, that's also fine.

Yeah, okay. I think by the end of the weekend we'll if we start doing the ARP. I think the only reason before we didn't have exact questions was the fact that we didn't have very precise direction. But now that we have a structured letter and argumentative, we have more questions that would pop up that we could refer the government to in terms of data, right? Yeah, so I think we can work on ARP, and hopefully by the before this weekend, we would have a letter and a series of questions that we would like to know, like, in terms of information that we'd like to know from the government.

Okay, that's good. Um, yeah. So uh.
