So I'm going to record this so later you can refer to, we already have the WhatsApp group, right? Okay, so I'm not going to just kind of limit your your thinking, but I want to make a few suggestions. Okay, so number one is, you can see that there's the anti deception that coordination agency or something, right? So if you go to that website, then there's a link for reporting the like a year report. Do you know the link you go to that that? So basically, we're talking about the mechanism for report this kind of cases, or how to contact the police. It seems like it's not so straightforward. Okay, so I think that might be an area to look into. So the question here is, to what extent we are offering a very convenient channel or sort of access for reporting to the police. Okay, so, so that's one, one area to look into. Another area is to compare, compare Hong Kong with mainland China, because Mainland China has got an app for just my father also have that, yeah. So Hong Kong also has an app so we can compare. There must be, you know, advantage, there must be some strengths and weaknesses on both sides. And we can say, you know, maybe Hong Kong can learn from mainland China a little bit, you see, I mean, so that's an that's an area you uh, and also, we might be able to approach the police and ask for more information or data regarding the types of scams. So, so I'm sure that there must be some kind of taxonomy, some kind of categories of different kinds of crimes. And I think that kind of information, if not publicly available, we can request and then we can say, Look, we should, based on this data, to design the campaign for anti scamming education. So these are a couple of ideas you might want to explore. But I think this is a very important issue, right? Because actually, every year there's young people and also people from different backgrounds, they they suffer from this. So I'm sure that the police has been very active trying to, trying to do this, but it's always useful to, you know, take a different perspective and try to identify room for improvement. And the police is they are quite they are quite responsive. They are quite collaborative when it comes to responding to our inquiries. Because they have, they have a whole lot of, you know, ways we can make complaints and everything so so they will take us very seriously. Yeah, okay, yeah, because you mentioned that, after we, like, figure out other, like, type of scams and the like, we have the basic information right, the design campaign for the entire schedule, not necessary to design a new campaign, we can look at the current campaign and see whether there's any room for improvement. So I think one way is really just to look at the data the you know, because you know, if you go to the newspaper, they only give you an accurate amount, how much money has been lost in the past six months or a year or two years, there's increase decrease. But we don't know the details. We don't know the specific types of, you know, crimes or victims. There must be some kind of taxonomy or categorization that has been built. So that's the first step, just to get more information. And then we can start looking at the current strategies of their education campaign and see if there's any room for improvement. Okay, so I will.
