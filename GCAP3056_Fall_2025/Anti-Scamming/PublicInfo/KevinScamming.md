5.协同生态系统

App如何与其他防骗措施配合?

跨部门协作:与银行、电讯商等机构的数据共享和联动机制有效性，

「可疑帳號警示」機制覆蓋範圍擴大至網上銀行及櫃位轉帳

[https://www.hkma.gov.hk/chi/news-and-media/press-releases/2024/08/20240801-5/](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/chi/news-and-media/press-releases/2024/08/20240801-5/)

此外，警方也會將資料庫涉嫌詐騙的電話號碼及網站資料轉交電訊商，電訊商會根據警方提供的詐騙記錄及資料，封鎖有關電話號碼或停止服務，並阻截用戶登入懷疑詐騙網站。截至二○二四年十一月底，按警方要求，電訊商成功攔截約25 100個涉及詐騙案的網頁連結及封鎖或停止超過8 000個涉嫌進行詐騙的電話號碼。

　　另外，警方也與銀行業界緊密合作，善用「防騙視伏器」數據，並於二○二三年十一月推出第一階段的可疑賬號警示，初期覆蓋轉數快平台交易渠道。其後於二○二四年八月及十二月分別推出第二及第三階段，覆蓋範圍擴展至網上銀行、櫃檯交易及自動櫃員機（包括存鈔機），提供更全面的保障，系統將在交易確認前發出警示，提醒市民有潛在詐騙風險。

公众参与:公众通过App举报的线索数量及其转化为有效预警的比例。

立法會七題：打擊釣魚騙案

（三）自「防騙視伏器」在二○二二年九月推出以來，截至二○二四年十一月，共錄得超過648萬次搜尋，預警約83萬次詐騙及網絡安全風險，市民也透過「防騙視伏器」內的公眾舉報平台舉報超過31萬個可疑來電及超過32 000 個可疑網站，成效顯著。

step 1:  Find singapore related information ( question：  just see the function?//每個人做翻自己本身負責個方面？ ）

privacy：相比起來新加坡是在雲端處理，香港是在本地處理，似乎香港更好一點lol
