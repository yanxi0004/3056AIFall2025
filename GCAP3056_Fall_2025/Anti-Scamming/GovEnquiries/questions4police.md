## TOP PRIORITY QUESTIONS (15 Questions)

### **App Usage & Effectiveness (5 Questions)**

**1. How many users actively use the 防騙視伏器 app on a daily/weekly/monthly basis?**
- **Context**: Despite 96+ million downloads, we need to understand actual engagement vs. symbolic adoption
- **Argument Development**: Low active usage supports our claim that the app is more symbolic than effective
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Direct evidence for "illusion of security" argument

**2. How many suspicious contacts/websites have been checked through the app since launch?**
- **Context**: We need concrete usage data to assess real-world impact
- **Argument Development**: Low usage numbers support claims of ineffective user-dependent design
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Quantifies the gap between downloads and actual protection

**3. What is the user satisfaction rating and most common complaints about the app?**
- **Context**: Public app store reviews show mixed feedback, but we need official data
- **Argument Development**: User dissatisfaction supports our technical limitations argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Evidence for poor user experience claims

**4. How many users have uninstalled the app and what are the main reasons?**
- **Context**: High uninstall rates would indicate fundamental design problems
- **Argument Development**: Uninstall data supports our argument about user-dependent design flaws
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Demonstrates app abandonment despite government promotion

**5. What is the accuracy rate of the app's database (false positives/negatives)?**
- **Context**: Static database approach may have accuracy issues compared to AI-powered systems
- **Argument Development**: Low accuracy supports our argument for AI-powered detection like Singapore
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Technical limitation evidence for international comparison

### **Website Usage & Engagement (3 Questions)**

**6. What is the monthly unique visitor count and engagement rate for cyberdefender.hk?**
- **Context**: Website has extensive content but we need to understand actual usage
- **Argument Development**: Low engagement supports our fragmented approach argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Evidence for poor public penetration despite comprehensive content

**7. How many users have accessed educational resources (IT basics, device security, etc.)?**
- **Context**: Educational content exists but we need to measure actual impact
- **Argument Development**: Low educational engagement supports our digital literacy gap argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Shows content without impact

**8. How many suspicious contacts have been checked through the website interface?**
- **Context**: Website offers same functionality as app but we need usage comparison
- **Argument Development**: Low website usage supports our mobile-only limitation argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Demonstrates platform fragmentation

### **Transparency & Data Governance (4 Questions)**

**9. Why are detailed usage statistics not publicly available on the website?**
- **Context**: CyberDefender website lacks transparency about its own effectiveness
- **Argument Development**: Lack of transparency supports our accountability argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Direct evidence for transparency deficit

**10. What personal data is collected from users and how is it protected?**
- **Context**: Website collects extensive data but privacy policy lacks detail
- **Argument Development**: Data collection concerns support our governance argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Privacy and data security evidence

**11. How often is the suspicious database updated and what is the update process?**
- **Context**: Static database approach may be outdated compared to real-time threats
- **Argument Development**: Update frequency supports our technological limitations argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Technical limitation evidence

**12. What performance metrics are tracked but not published?**
- **Context**: Government likely tracks effectiveness but doesn't share data
- **Argument Development**: Hidden metrics support our transparency argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Evidence for lack of public accountability

### **Vulnerable Population Protection (2 Questions)**

**13. What percentage of app users are aged 60 and above, and how effective is the app for elderly users?**
- **Context**: Elderly are primary targets for telephone scams but may struggle with app usage
- **Argument Development**: Low elderly usage supports our vulnerable population argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Demographics evidence for targeted protection needs

**14. How many student scam cases have been prevented through platform usage?**
- **Context**: Students lose up to HK$1.7 million but we need to measure platform effectiveness
- **Argument Development**: Low prevention rate supports our education gap argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Student protection evidence

### **Effectiveness & Impact (1 Question)**

**15. How many scam attempts have been prevented and what is the estimated financial loss prevented?**
- **Context**: Despite 44,480 cases in 2024, we need to measure actual prevention
- **Argument Development**: Low prevention rate supports our fundamental effectiveness argument
- **SCMP Letter Impact**: Core evidence for platform ineffectiveness
