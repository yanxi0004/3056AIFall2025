#### Elaboration

The shift to a dedicated housekeeping tab clarifies that procedural norms (communication protocols, task tracking, deadline adherence) are now central to collaborative success. While the membership table and timeline were previously framed as isolated deliverables, their absence in the new focus suggests a pivot toward discussing process standards rather than merely documenting them. This implies students should engage critically with how tasks are managed (e.g., accountability, conflict resolution) rather than treating administrative artifacts as ends in themselves.

#### Student Questions

What specific housekeeping "manners" are most critical to address first (e.g., late work policies, meeting etiquette)?
How will individual responsibilities be assigned if the membership table isn’t finalized?
If the timeline is tentative, what’s the process for renegotiating deadlines if workloads shift?
Should housekeeping discussions focus on hypothetical scenarios or current friction points?

#### Next Steps

Draft a membership table (Name | ID | Role | Contact) to clarify accountability.
Outline timeline phases: Week 3-4 (norms setup), Week 5-7 (task execution), Week 8-10 (revisions/final checks).
Create a discussion thread for students to propose/add housekeeping guidelines (e.g., "How should we handle missed deadlines?").
