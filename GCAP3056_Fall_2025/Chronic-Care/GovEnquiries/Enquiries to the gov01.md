## Team Member 1: Financial Analysis & Cost-Effectiveness
**Target Department**: Department of Health
**Focus**: Understanding program economics and cost-effectiveness

### Question 1: Total Program Expenditure and Cost Breakdown
**Context**: Our research shows the scheme has enrolled 131,200 participants with 74,900 completing screening. To evaluate cost-effectiveness against international benchmarks (like Singapore's Screen for Life program), we need comprehensive financial data.

**Request**: Please provide:
1. Total government expenditure for the CDCC Pilot Scheme from November 2023 to present
2. Detailed breakdown of expenditure by category: screening subsidies, treatment subsidies, promotional costs, administrative costs
3. Average cost per participant by stage (enrolled, screened, treated)

**Argument Development**: This data will enable us to calculate cost-effectiveness ratios, compare with international programs, and develop evidence-based recommendations for budget optimization and resource allocation.

### Question 2: Patient Financial Burden Analysis
**Context**: Current data shows median co-payment of HK$150, but we need to understand the full financial impact on patients to assess accessibility barriers.

**Request**: Please provide:
1. Average total out-of-pocket costs per patient per year (including consultation fees, medication costs, transportation)
2. Breakdown of costs by income level/eligibility category
3. Analysis of financial barriers preventing participation or treatment continuation

**Argument Development**: This information will support arguments for reducing financial barriers and implementing sliding-scale fees, similar to successful international programs.

### Question 3: Cost-Benefit Analysis and Healthcare Savings
**Context**: The government has projected HK$2.7 billion in potential healthcare savings. We need to verify these projections with actual data.

**Request**: Please provide:
1. Actual healthcare cost savings achieved through early detection and treatment (if available)
2. Cost per patient for CDCC services vs. traditional public healthcare costs for chronic disease management
3. Government projections for long-term cost savings based on current participation rates

**Argument Development**: This data will strengthen arguments for expanding the program and demonstrate return on investment to justify increased funding.

## Team Member 2: Participation Barriers & Dropout Analysis
**Target Department**: Department of Health
**Focus**: Understanding why 60,000 enrolled participants haven't proceeded to screening

### Question 4: Participation Gap Analysis
**Context**: With 131,200 enrolled but only 74,900 screened, there's a significant participation gap that needs investigation to improve program effectiveness.

**Request**: Please provide:

**Request**: Please provide:
1. Geographic distribution of participants by district
2. Demographic breakdown of participants (age, gender, income, education, employment status)
3. Number of service points by district and their accessibility indicators

**Argument Development**: This data will support arguments for expanding service networks, improving accessibility, and developing targeted promotion strategies for underserved populations.

### Question 6: Treatment Continuity and Retention Analysis
**Context**: Understanding treatment dropout rates and retention challenges is crucial for evaluating long-term program effectiveness.

**Request**: Please provide:
1. Number of participants who continue treatment at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months
2. List of reasons for treatment discontinuation (if tracked): cost, accessibility, satisfaction, health outcomes
