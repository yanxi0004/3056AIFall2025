Dear Access to Information officer,

I am writing to request information under the code on access to information for academic research purpose.

Student Details:

Name: [Your Name]

University: Hong Kong Baptist University

Course: GCAP3056 Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendation

Project Title: [Project Title]

Purpose: This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to our project which conducts an analysis of the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme. Through a formal request under the Code on Access to Information, we will obtain relevant data to evaluate the scheme's efficacy in two critical areas: the sufficiency of its promotional strategies in achieving large-scale screening participation, and the effectiveness of its treatment pathway in promoting early intervention and long-term retention in family doctor care.

Information Requested:

1. Request For Total Scheme Subsidy Since Inception

We respectfully seek the official and exact total subsidy of the scheme from its launch date to the present. As referenced on the government’s official website, an estimated expenditure of no less than $17 million ($196 x 90000 patients) was allocated to the screening stage; however, no publicly available details specify the full breakdown of expenditure—including (but not limited to) total subsidy for lab investigation, total fee for meeting doctors once at screening stage , total treatment costs, and promotion-related expenses. We therefore request the complete and verified expenditure breakdown for the scheme.

2. Request For Promotion Information

It is noted that there is no information regarding the promotion fee, promotion channels and the effectiveness of the promotion on the scheme-related document. We would be grateful if you could provide this information to facilitate an analysis of the promotion's impact.

3. Request for Analysis of Scheme Drop-Off Rate

It is noted from public records that 150,000 individuals have registered for the scheme, yet only 90,000 have progressed to the screening stage—representing a significant drop-off rate [[https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800547.htm](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800547.htm)]. We respectfully ask whether the government has conducted tracking or analysis to identify the reasons for this drop-off and, if so, request the release of any preliminary findings, reports, or assessments outlining these reasons.

4. Request for the proportion of participated private doctors.

It is noted that approximately 600 private doctors are currently participating in the program. We would like to ask about the percentage of private doctors in Hong Kong that are taking part in this scheme as we would like to speculate more on the involvement of doctors.

5. Request for the Latest Number of Participants Involved in Different Stages

Based on the document titled "Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (‘Co-Care Scheme’) Participation and Screening Data" ([P2025021900197_486436_1_1739939303398.pdf](https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202502/19/P2025021900197_486436_1_1739939303398.pdf)) as of 13 February 2025, we understand the following statistics have been released:

Cumulative participants in the ‘Co-Care Scheme’: 101,800

1. Participants who have completed pre-screening consultation: 74,000
2. Participants who have completed screening: 58,700
3. Participants who have entered the treatment stage: 22,000

As this data is from early 2025, we respectfully request the most up-to-date figures to better understand the scheme's current progress. Specifically, we would be grateful if you could provide the following latest data points:

1. The total number of participants that have enrolled in the scheme to date.
2. The total number of participants who have completed the screening stage.
3. A breakdown of the total number of participants diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension, including the number of participants diagnosed with both conditions.
4. The total number of participants who have been in the treatment stage for more than six months.
5. For the cohort of participants who have been in the treatment stage for more than six months, the cumulative number of treatments they have received.

This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to our project. If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely
