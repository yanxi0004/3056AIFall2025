# SCMP Letter Strategy - Emergency Alert System Project

## Overview
Strategic plan for two SCMP letters to be published in November 2024, marking the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System launch.

## Letter 1: "Learning from International Best Practices" 
**Target Publication: Early November 2024 (5th Anniversary)**
**Word Count: ~200 words**

### Strategic Objectives
- Leverage 5th anniversary timing for maximum impact
- Position Hong Kong's system against international benchmarks
- Establish credibility through comparative analysis
- Set foundation for second letter

### Key Arguments

#### 1. International Comparison Framework
- **Japan**: Regular weather alerts, earthquake warnings, tsunami alerts
- **UK**: Dedicated online platform with transparency features
- **US**: Amber alerts for child abduction, weather warnings, public safety
- **Singapore**: Multi-purpose alerts including traffic, weather, health

#### 2. Hong Kong's Underutilization Problem
- System used only 26 times in 14 years (old system data)
- New system: minimal usage despite HK$150M investment
- Missed opportunities for weather warnings (black rainstorm example)
- Lack of systematic categorization of alert types

#### 3. Specific Recommendations
- Expand activation criteria beyond extreme emergencies
- Implement regular system testing with public education
- Create transparent online platform for alert history
- Develop clear protocols for different emergency types

### Letter Structure
1. **Hook**: Reference to 5th anniversary and public confusion during first test
2. **Problem**: Hong Kong's system sits idle while other countries use similar systems proactively
3. **Solution**: Learn from international best practices
4. **Call to Action**: Urge government to expand system usage and improve transparency

### Target Departments for Research
- Security Bureau (activation protocols)
- Hong Kong Observatory (weather integration)
- Police Force (public safety alerts)
- OFCA (system operations)

## Letter 2: "Preparing for the Unthinkable"
**Target Publication: Late November 2024**
**Word Count: ~200 words**

### Strategic Objectives
- Build on first letter's momentum
- Address critical infrastructure failure scenarios
- Challenge government preparedness for extreme situations
- Propose comprehensive emergency response framework

### Key Arguments

#### 1. Infrastructure Failure Scenarios
- Internet/telecommunications blackout
- Power grid failure
- Natural disasters affecting critical infrastructure
- Cyber attacks on communication systems

#### 2. Government Preparedness Gaps
- No clear protocols for infrastructure failure scenarios
- Lack of public education on emergency response
- Absence of alternative communication methods
- Unclear decision-making hierarchy during crises

#### 3. Comprehensive Response Framework
- Multi-layered communication strategy
- Public education and training programs
- Alternative communication channels
- Clear escalation procedures

### Letter Structure
1. **Hook**: "What happens when the internet goes down?"
2. **Problem**: Government lacks comprehensive emergency response plan
3. **Solution**: Develop multi-layered emergency communication strategy
4. **Call to Action**: Demand transparent emergency preparedness planning

### Research Focus Areas
- Government contingency plans for infrastructure failure
- Alternative communication methods during crises
- Public education on emergency response
- International models for extreme emergency scenarios
