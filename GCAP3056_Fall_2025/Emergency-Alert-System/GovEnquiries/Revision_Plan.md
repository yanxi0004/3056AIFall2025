# Revision Plan for Consolidated Government Enquiries

## Overview
This revision plan addresses the need to sharpen each enquiry set to reliably elicit concrete, citable facts that directly support the two SCMP letters and ARP development.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have vs. What We Need

**We Have:**
- Launch date (November 26, 2020)
- Purpose statement and development cost (HK$150M)
- Technology details (cell broadcast)
- Public criticism around September 2023 rainstorm
- Public confusion during early tests

**We Still Need:**
- Annual OPEX/maintenance costs
- Upgrade/replacement cycles
- Device coverage rates
- Activation criteria (written SOPs)
- Governance/approval flow
- Testing cadence and after-action reviews
- Public education plan and metrics
- Examples of when EAS was considered but not used (and why)
- Cross-department roles during activation
- International comparator examples (UK, Japan, Singapore, US)

## Strategic Revision Framework

### 1. Sharpen Each Enquiry Set for Concrete, Citable Facts

#### Key Principles:
- Ask for documents, dates, figures, and examples
- Request specific formats: PDFs, SOP titles, dates, URLs
- Ask for "last 24 months" stats to keep time-bounded
- Include "if not available, explain why and when it will be available"

#### Enhanced Question Structure:
- **Document Requests**: "Please provide [specific document name/version/date]"
- **Data Requests**: "Please provide [specific metrics] for the last 24 months"
- **Example Requests**: "Please provide two anonymized case studies from the past 24 months"
- **Timeline Requests**: "Please provide [specific information] as of [month/year]"

### 2. Map Each Question to the Two Letters

#### Letter 1: International Best Practices
**Data Sources:**
- **Costs**: CEO Office, OFCA → "value for money" and transparency
- **Activation breadth**: Security Bureau, FSD, Health, EEB → "underuse vs. comparator countries"
- **Testing and education**: OFCA, SB, FSD, Health → public familiarity gap
- **Coordination**: SB-led RACI + SLAs → optimization, speed

#### Letter 2: Infrastructure Vulnerability
**Data Sources:**
- **Dependencies and failure modes**: OFCA + CEO → single point of failure
- **Backup channels**: all departments → redundancy roadmap
- **Exercises/AARs**: SB, FSD, OFCA → preparedness gaps and remedies

### 3. Specify Exact "Evidence We Need" to Plug Gaps

#### Critical Evidence Gaps:
1. **Cost Transparency**: Annual OPEX, maintenance breakdown, vendor contracts
2. **Activation Criteria**: Written SOPs, decision chain, approval thresholds
3. **Testing Protocols**: Cadence, coverage, delivery rates, after-action reviews
4. **Public Education**: Outreach metrics, awareness levels, comprehension rates
5. **International Benchmarks**: Comparator usage patterns, best practices
6. **Infrastructure Resilience**: Dependencies, failure modes, backup systems

## Department-Specific Revision Strategies

## Email Drafting Guidance

### Consistent Frame for All Emails:
- **Subject**: Request for documents and data: Emergency Alert System (EAS) [Department]
- **Opening**: Cite purpose, course project, 21-day response, and that replies may inform public-interest analysis and letters
- **Request list**: Numbered, each with "please provide document name/version/date; if unavailable, indicate why and when"
- **Closing**: Offer to clarify; request a departmental contact; note willingness to narrow scope if needed

### Example Opening Paragraph:
"We are conducting a non-partisan public-interest analysis of Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) for a university policy project. To ensure accuracy and balance, we request the following documents and data under your department's purview. Where items are not public, please indicate the legal basis for non-disclosure and, if possible, provide redacted summaries or metadata. We aim to publish preliminary findings in November and will acknowledge departmental inputs."
