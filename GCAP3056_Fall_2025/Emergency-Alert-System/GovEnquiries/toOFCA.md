Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name: Lau Zhi Yi
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
OFCA is responsible for the technical implementation and maintenance of Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS), which employs cell broadcast service technology to disseminate messages to mobile users during emergencies. The system was launched on November 26, 2020, and relies on mobile network infrastructure to reach citizens. However, concerns have been raised about system reliability during infrastructure failures and limited public awareness of the system's capabilities.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Cost Analysis and System Coverage:**
   - What is the annual budget or maintenance cost allocated for the operation and upkeep of the Emergency Alert System (EAS)?
   - What percentage of mobile devices in Hong Kong are compatible with the EAS, and what steps are being taken to increase this coverage?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS was implemented in 2020 with a development cost of HK$150 million, and only mobile devices that support cell broadcast service technology can receive EAS messages.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding the financial investment and device compatibility will help assess the system's cost-effectiveness and identify gaps in coverage, supporting arguments for broader accessibility initiatives.

2. **Infrastructure Vulnerability and Contingency Planning:**
   - Will the EAS be operational in the case of an unforeseen Internet outage in the entire Hong Kong, possibly due to the destruction of a satellite by solar flares or an undersea fibre optic by a geomagnetic storm?
   - What alternative communication methods are available when the EAS is not operational?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS relies on cell broadcast service technology, which may be vulnerable during infrastructure failures, creating a single point of failure.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for developing backup communication systems and enhancing infrastructure resilience to address critical vulnerabilities.

3. **System Testing and Public Awareness:**
   - How frequently is the EAS tested to ensure its functionality, and what measures are in place to ensure public awareness and preparedness?
   - What initiatives has OFCA undertaken to raise public awareness about the EAS and its functionalities?
   - *Public Information Link*: OFCA has released press statements and maintains a webpage detailing the EAS and compatible devices, but public awareness appears limited.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for regular system evaluations and comprehensive public education campaigns to ensure widespread understanding of the EAS.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations for system optimization.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
