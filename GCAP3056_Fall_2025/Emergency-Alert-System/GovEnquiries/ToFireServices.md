Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name: Lau Zhi Yi
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
The Fire Services Department plays a crucial role in Hong Kong's emergency response system, particularly during natural disasters, fires, and other emergencies that may require public evacuation or safety measures. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements during emergencies, but its integration with fire services operations remains unclear. The system has been operational since November 2020, yet concerns have been raised about its limited usage during significant emergencies.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Integration with Emergency Response Protocols:**
   - How does the Fire Services Department integrate the EAS into its emergency response protocols, particularly for natural disasters and fire emergencies?
   - What role does the EAS play in alerting the public about fire-related emergencies, evacuations, or safety measures?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is intended to facilitate the public in adopting contingency measures quickly during emergencies, but its specific integration with fire services remains unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding this integration will help assess the system's practical utility and inform recommendations for enhanced emergency response strategies.

2. **Training and Coordination:**
   - What training programs are in place for Fire Services personnel regarding the utilization of the EAS during fire emergencies?
   - What coordination mechanisms exist between the Fire Services Department and other agencies in disseminating fire-related alerts via the EAS?
   - *Public Information Link*: The Security Bureau has conducted large-scale exercises and departmental training for emergency services, but specific EAS training for fire services personnel is not publicly documented.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for continuous education and training to ensure effective use of the EAS in fire-related emergencies.

3. **Public Safety Communication:**
   - What public education initiatives has the Fire Services Department conducted regarding fire safety and emergency preparedness?
   - How does the department communicate with the public during fire emergencies, and what role does the EAS play in this communication?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements, but public education about fire safety and EAS usage appears limited.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for enhanced public education campaigns and clearer communication strategies during fire emergencies.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations for system optimization.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
