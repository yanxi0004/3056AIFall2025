**Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name:
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System (EAS) in Hong Kong

In light of the information provided by the Secretary for Security, Mr. Tang Ping-keung, during the Legislative Council session on October 18, 2023, where it was stated that "under truly justified emergency situations, B/Ds may disseminate EAS Messages through the EAS terminals to enable immediate responsive actions by the public," we are keen to delve deeper into this subject and request additional information and details.

(Attached below is the link for your reference: [https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202310/18/P2023101800416.htm?fontSize=1](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202310/18/P2023101800416.htm?fontSize=1))

Information Requested:

1. Which specific government department or office holds the primary responsibility for sending messages in EAS?
2. Which specific government department or office holds the primary responsibility for authorising and deciding the content of messages to be disseminated via the EAS?
3. Do you have a team or what mechanisms are in place for sending messages in EAS?
4. If yes, how will you determine the content of messages sent through EAS?

Purpose: This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong.

Timeframe: If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
