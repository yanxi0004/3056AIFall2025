Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:

University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
According to the government's announcement on November 26, 2020, the Emergency Alert System (EAS) was launched to disseminate real-time messages during emergencies that may cause territory-wide/large-scale outage of critical infrastructure or extensively endanger lives and properties. The system has been operational for nearly four years, yet public concerns have been raised about its limited usage during significant emergencies, such as the severe rainstorm in September 2023.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Budget Transparency and Cost-Effectiveness:**
   - What is the annual budget or maintenance cost allocated for the operation and upkeep of the Emergency Alert System (EAS)?
   - Can you provide a detailed breakdown of the HK$150 million development cost mentioned in public reports, including ongoing maintenance and operational expenses?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS was implemented in 2020 with a development cost of HK$150 million, as reported in various media outlets.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding the financial investment will help assess the system's cost-effectiveness and justify recommendations for optimal resource utilization.

2. **Activation Criteria and Decision-Making Process:**
   - Are there any existing internal guidelines for categorizing emergencies and drafting EAS messages?
   - How does the government determine when an emergency warrants EAS activation versus other communication channels?
   - *Public Information Link*: Public criticism arose due to the non-utilization of the EAS during significant emergencies like the September 2023 rainstorm.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding the decision-making criteria will help identify gaps in the current activation protocols and advocate for clearer guidelines.

3. **Contingency Planning and Infrastructure Resilience:**
   - What are the standard operating procedures and contingency plans that the government follows during a major emergency, especially when there is an unforeseen Internet outage?
   - What alternative communication methods are available when the EAS is not operational?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS relies on cell broadcast service technology, which may be vulnerable during infrastructure failures.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for developing backup communication systems and enhancing infrastructure resilience.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
