Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name: Lau Zhi Yi
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
The Environment Bureau is responsible for environmental policy and emergency response in Hong Kong, particularly for environmental hazards and natural disasters. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is intended for emergencies that may endanger lives and properties, including extreme weather events, but its specific integration with environmental emergency response remains unclear. The system has been operational since November 2020, yet concerns have been raised about its limited usage during significant emergencies, including environmental incidents.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Environmental Hazard Alerts:**
   - In what ways does the Environment Bureau employ the EAS to warn the public about environmental hazards, such as severe pollution or natural disasters?
   - What criteria determine when an environmental emergency warrants EAS activation versus other communication channels?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is intended for dissemination of time-critical public announcements during emergencies like extreme weather, but specific criteria for environmental activation remain unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding this usage will support arguments for a more proactive approach to environmental hazard communication and identify gaps in current protocols.

2. **Collaboration with Meteorological Services:**
   - What collaborative efforts exist between the Environment Bureau and meteorological services to disseminate timely environmental alerts via the EAS?
   - How does the Environment Bureau coordinate with other agencies in disseminating environmental alerts via the EAS?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is intended for situations like extreme weather that causes extensive infrastructure damage, but specific coordination mechanisms remain unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding collaboration mechanisms will support arguments for integrated environmental alert systems and improved inter-agency coordination.

3. **Public Education and Preparedness:**
   - What public education initiatives has the Environment Bureau conducted regarding environmental emergencies and emergency preparedness?
   - How does the Environment Bureau communicate with the public during environmental crises, and what role does the EAS play in this communication?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements during environmental incidents, but public education about environmental emergency preparedness and EAS usage appears limited.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for enhanced public education campaigns and clearer communication strategies during environmental emergencies.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations for system optimization.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
