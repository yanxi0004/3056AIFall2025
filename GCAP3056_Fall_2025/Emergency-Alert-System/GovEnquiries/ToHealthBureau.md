Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name: Lau Zhi Yi
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
The Health Bureau is responsible for public health policy and emergency response in Hong Kong. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements during serious public safety and health incidents, but its specific integration with health emergency response remains unclear. The system has been operational since November 2020, yet concerns have been raised about its limited usage during significant emergencies, including health-related incidents.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Public Health Emergency Protocols:**
   - What criteria does the Health Bureau use to determine when to issue health-related alerts through the EAS?
   - How does the Health Bureau utilize the EAS to communicate urgent public health information to the public?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements during serious public safety and health incidents, but specific criteria for health-related activation remain unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding these criteria will help develop arguments for timely and appropriate health communications and identify gaps in current protocols.

2. **Coordination and Evaluation:**
   - What coordination mechanisms exist between the Health Bureau and other agencies in disseminating health alerts via the EAS?
   - Has the Health Bureau conducted evaluations on the effectiveness of health alerts disseminated via the EAS?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS has been in operation since 2020, with various departments utilizing it for emergency messaging, but health-specific coordination and evaluation mechanisms remain unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding coordination and evaluation mechanisms will support arguments for improved inter-agency collaboration and continuous improvement of health alert systems.

3. **Public Health Communication:**
   - What public education initiatives has the Health Bureau conducted regarding health emergencies and emergency preparedness?
   - How does the Health Bureau communicate with the public during health crises, and what role does the EAS play in this communication?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements during health incidents, but public education about health emergency preparedness and EAS usage appears limited.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for enhanced public education campaigns and clearer communication strategies during health emergencies.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations for system optimization.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
