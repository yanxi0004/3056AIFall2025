Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name: Lau Zhi Yi
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
The Security Bureau oversees Hong Kong's Emergency Response System and coordinates emergency responses across various departments. According to the Secretary for Security's statement on October 18, 2023, "under truly justified emergency situations, B/Ds may disseminate EAS Messages through the EAS terminals to enable immediate responsive actions by the public." However, public concerns have been raised about the system's limited activation during significant emergencies, such as the September 2023 rainstorm.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Expanded Usage for Public Safety and Criminal Threats:**
   - The United States uses Wireless Emergency Alerts for child abduction cases. Although events such as child kidnapping and human trafficking are rare in Hong Kong, there are criminal threats in Hong Kong that risk public safety.
   - How will the government handle the kind of cases that other countries would handle using EAS? Will the government start activating EAS for these criminal cases and other similar circumstances?
   - *Public Information Link*: International best practices show that emergency alert systems can be effectively used for various public safety threats beyond extreme emergencies.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for expanding EAS usage beyond extreme scenarios to include daily public safety concerns, demonstrating the system's underutilization.

2. **Inter-Departmental Coordination and Emergency Response Protocols:**
   - How does the Security Bureau coordinate with other departments to ensure timely and accurate dissemination of emergency alerts?
   - What are the standard operating procedures and contingency plans that the government follows during a major emergency?
   - *Public Information Link*: The Security Bureau's Emergency Response System outlines policies and operations for various emergencies, but coordination mechanisms during EAS activation remain unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding coordination mechanisms will highlight strengths and weaknesses in the current system, informing recommendations for improved inter-departmental collaboration.

3. **Public Communication and System Testing:**
   - What are the government's official expectations or guidelines for citizen conduct upon receiving an emergency alert?
   - How frequently is the EAS tested to ensure its functionality, and what measures are in place to ensure public awareness and preparedness?
   - *Public Information Link*: Public criticism arose due to the non-utilization of the EAS during significant emergencies, indicating gaps in public communication and feedback mechanisms.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for regular system evaluations and comprehensive public education campaigns to maintain reliability and ensure widespread understanding.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations for system optimization.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
