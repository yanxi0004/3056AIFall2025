# Government Enquiry Review & Argument Development Strategy

## Draft Enquiry Review Checklist


I think each question we ask should be linked to some publicly available info as well as the arguments we plan to develop 

this is the key principle for writing enquiries to the gov


### CEO Office Enquiry (ToCEO.md)

- **Budget transparency**: Request annual EAS costs - potential for "wasted investment" argument
- **Contingency planning**: SOPs during emergencies - reveals preparedness gaps
- **Message guidelines**: Internal categorization system - shows limited scope
- **Citizen expectations**: Public guidance protocols - demonstrates lack of public education

### OFCA Enquiry (toOFCA.md)

- **Cost analysis**: Annual budget allocation - supports resource waste argument
- **Internet dependency**: System failure scenarios - critical vulnerability exposure
- **Contingency procedures**: Alternative communication methods - reveals single point of failure
- **Public guidance**: Citizen response protocols - shows inadequate public preparation

### Security Bureau Enquiry (ToSecurityBureau.md)

- **Criminal threat response**: EAS usage for public safety crimes - expands beyond extreme emergencies
- **International comparison**: US child abduction alerts - demonstrates underutilization
- **Operational procedures**: Emergency response protocols - reveals limited activation criteria
- **Public safety scope**: Current vs. potential usage - shows missed opportunities

### Department/Bureau Enquiry (toSelectedDepartmentBureaus.md)

- **Authority structure**: Message authorization hierarchy - identifies decision-making bottlenecks
- **Content determination**: Message drafting process - reveals restrictive criteria
- **Operational teams**: EAS management structure - shows limited resources/coordination
- **Decision mechanisms**: Activation criteria - demonstrates narrow scope

## How Government Responses Will Strengthen ARP Arguments

### Cost & Resource Arguments

- **If high costs revealed**: "Significant public investment with minimal usage"
- **If costs withheld**: "Lack of transparency in public spending"
- **Budget allocation**: "Resources could be better utilized for regular public safety"

### System Limitations & Vulnerabilities

- **Internet dependency**: "Single point of failure in critical infrastructure"
- **Limited scope**: "System designed only for extreme scenarios, missing daily public safety needs"
- **No alternatives**: "No backup communication during system failures"

### Underutilization Evidence

- **Narrow activation criteria**: "System sits idle while other cities use alerts for weather, traffic, health"
- **Limited department access**: "Bureaucratic barriers prevent effective usage"
- **No public education**: "Citizens unprepared for system usage"

### International Comparison Opportunities

- **US child abduction alerts**: "Hong Kong could use EAS for missing persons, traffic incidents"
- **Weather warnings**: "Other cities use alerts for typhoons, flooding, heat waves"
- **Public health**: "COVID-19 could have utilized EAS for health alerts"

## Strategic Argument Development

### Letter to Editor Focus 1 (Mid-October)

- **International best practices**: Use responses about limited scope vs. international usage
- **System optimization**: Reference cost data to argue for expanded usage
- **Public education**: Use lack of citizen guidance to call for better preparation

### Letter to Editor Focus 2 (Late November)

- **Infrastructure vulnerability**: Use internet dependency responses to highlight risks
- **Emergency preparedness**: Reference contingency plan gaps
- **System reliability**: Use technical limitation responses to argue for improvements

### ARP Letter Strategy Alignment

- **Cost transparency**: Connect budget responses to "wasted investment" narrative
- **System expansion**: Use limited scope responses to advocate for broader usage
- **Public safety**: Use criminal threat responses to argue for expanded activation criteria
- **Emergency preparedness**: Use contingency responses to highlight preparedness gaps

## Action Items for Response Analysis

### Immediate Actions

- **Track response timelines**: 21-day standard period for all enquiries
- **Document response quality**: Note completeness, transparency, and helpfulness
- **Identify information gaps**: Mark what wasn't provided or was vague

### Response Integration Strategy

- **Quote directly**: Use government responses as evidence in letters
- **Highlight contradictions**: Compare responses across departments
- **Emphasize gaps**: Focus on what wasn't answered or was inadequate
- **Build credibility**: Reference official government statements in arguments

### Timeline Coordination

- **Mid-October letter**: Use early responses about costs and scope
- **Late November letter**: Use responses about infrastructure and preparedness
- **ARP letters**: Integrate all responses into comprehensive arguments
