Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS) - HKBU Student Research

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am writing to request information under the Code on Access to Information for academic research purposes.

Student Details:
Name: Lau Zhi Yi
University: Hong Kong Baptist University
Course: Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations
Project Title: Analysis of the usage of Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong

**Context and Public Information:**
The Hospital Authority is responsible for providing public healthcare services in Hong Kong and plays a critical role during public health emergencies. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) can be used for serious public safety and health incidents, but its specific integration with healthcare services remains unclear. The system has been operational since November 2020, yet concerns have been raised about its limited usage during significant emergencies, including health-related incidents.

**Information Requested:**

1. **Healthcare Facility Alert Integration:**
   - How does the Hospital Authority utilize the EAS to inform healthcare facilities and the public during health emergencies?
   - What role does the EAS play in alerting healthcare facilities about public health emergencies, disease outbreaks, or medical emergencies?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS can be used during large-scale public health emergency situations, but specific protocols for healthcare facility alerts are not publicly documented.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding this integration will help assess the system's practical utility in healthcare settings and inform recommendations for enhanced health-related emergency communications.

2. **Coordination with Other Agencies:**
   - What coordination mechanisms exist between the Hospital Authority and other agencies in disseminating health alerts via the EAS?
   - How does the Hospital Authority coordinate with the Health Bureau, Security Bureau, and other departments during health emergencies?
   - *Public Information Link*: The Security Bureau's Emergency Response System includes coordination among various departments, but specific health-related coordination mechanisms remain unclear.
   - *Argument Development*: Understanding these mechanisms will support arguments for improved inter-agency collaboration during health crises and enhanced public health communication.

3. **Public Health Communication:**
   - What public education initiatives has the Hospital Authority conducted regarding health emergencies and emergency preparedness?
   - How does the Hospital Authority communicate with the public during health crises, and what role does the EAS play in this communication?
   - *Public Information Link*: The EAS is designed to disseminate time-critical public announcements during health incidents, but public education about health emergency preparedness and EAS usage appears limited.
   - *Argument Development*: This information will support arguments for enhanced public education campaigns and clearer communication strategies during health emergencies.

**Purpose:** This information will be used solely for academic research and will contribute to a study on the effectiveness and operational framework of the Emergency Alert System in Hong Kong, with the aim of developing evidence-based policy recommendations for system optimization.

**Timeframe:** If possible, we would appreciate receiving this information within the standard 21-day period to align with our project timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with our research.

Yours sincerely,
Lau Zhi Yi
