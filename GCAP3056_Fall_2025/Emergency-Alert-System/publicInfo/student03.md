**Emergency alert system [source](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/11/20201126/20201126_141856_671.html)

* Disseminate important real-time messages to mobile phone users during emergency situations that may extensively endanger lives and property
* Employs cell broadcast service technology to disseminate real-time messages to mobile phones connected to mobile networks
* Message is classified as either “Emergency Alert” or “Extreme Emergency Alert” according to the incident’s severity
* During
  * extreme weather that causes extensive infrastructure damage
  * major public safety incidents
  * large-scale public health emergencies

1. Can it enlarge the range of conditions to send emergency alerts? However, there could be "alert fatigue" from receiving too many non-critical messages (e.g., AMBER Alerts) →need better geo-targeting and message flexibility
2. Conduct regular system tests (like US and UK) →assess system performance & allow the public to familiarise themselves with the alerts
3. Provide more details and guidelines for the alert and possible emergency cases e.g. app or webpage →promote transparency, enabling residents to verify alerts and understand the system’s operations

→ How about stating the criteria for the classification of alert and emergency, clarifying who the adopters are and the costs of the system →currently lack of transparency

4. All the systems are using cell broadcast technology →is it possible to send more accurate targeted messages to prevent overwhelming alerts?
