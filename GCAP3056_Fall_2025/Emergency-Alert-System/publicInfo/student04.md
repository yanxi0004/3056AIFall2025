**What are the emergency cases in Hong Kong?

Brief info about the system:

The Government has engaged local mobile network operators ("MNOs") to set up an emergency alert system (“EAS”) for dissemination of time-critical public announcements and messages ("EAS messages") via mobile networks to mobile service users during emergency situations like extreme weather, serious public safety and health incidents and more to facilitate the public to adopt contingency measures quickly.

There are two alert levels for EAS messages, namely "Extreme Emergency Alert" and "Emergency Alert". The Government Bureau or Department that disseminates the EAS message will designate the alert level according to the urgency or severity of the circumstances in question.

Info from the Office of the Communications Authority [https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/consumer_focus/guide/help_for_consumers/emergency_alert_system/index.html](https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/consumer_focus/guide/help_for_consumers/emergency_alert_system/index.html)

Three categories of emergency that are mentioned above:

1. Extreme weather

Super Typhoons (Extreme Emergency Alert): When the HKO issues the No. 10 Hurricane Signal. This signifies winds of hurricane force (118 km/h or more) are expected or blowing from the quarter.

![]()

"Black" Rainstorm Warning (Emergency Alert): When the HKO issues the Black Rainstorm Warning, meaning rainfall exceeds 70 mm per hour and is expected to continue. This alert warns of serious street flooding and landslides, advising the public to stay in a safe place.

2. Serious public safety

Definition: Sudden, large-scale events that endanger a large number of people and require urgent public evacuation or avoidance of an area.

Real Cases (Potential or Hypothetical based on the system's design):

Major Fires or Explosions: A large industrial fire or gas explosion in a densely populated area, with toxic smoke threatening nearby residential blocks. An alert would be sent to instruct residents in specific zones to evacuate or shelter-in-place.

Significant Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Leaks: A major chemical spill from an accident or a leak of dangerous gases. An alert would be used to warn people to immediately seal their windows, turn off ventilation, or evacuate.

Critical Infrastructure Failure: A major dam failure or a large-scale, imminent landslide identified by geotechnical instruments. An alert would be issued to evacuate the downstream or at-risk area immediately.

Major Security Threats: In the event of a very serious, ongoing, and widespread public security threat (e.g., a terrorist attack in a public area), alerts could be used to warn people to avoid the affected locations. This is a stated purpose of the system, though it has not been used for this reason in Hong Kong to date.

Examples of traffic incidents:

Public Transport Emergency

The source operator (i.e. the public transport operator having problem with provision of his service) should issue the “Amber Alert” or “Red Alert” by multi-fax as follows :

a) “Amber Alert” should be issued by the source operator if he assesses that an emergency situation which could lead to a serious disruption of service is likely to arise;

b) “Red Alert” should be issued by the source operator if the emergency incident has occurred and is expected to continue for over 20 minutes and emergency transport support services from other operators are required.

Major Road Obstructions

Generally, these road obstructions refer to those incidents that cause the closure of traffic lanes in one or both directions on major roads. The source agency in this case will be the first department or operator to become aware of the incident. For example, in case of traffic accidents, generally the Police is the source agency; in case of burst watermains, the Water Supplies Department would be the source agency. In case of tunnel incidents, the tunnel operator would be the source agency. On road incidents, the source agency should send out the alert message to relevant parties when a serious road incident is detected or expected to occur.

Serious road incidents refer to those resulting in :

a) complete closure of two or more lanes in one direction on a strategic route (e.g. Cross Harbour Tunnel, Tsing Ma Bridge, Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway) for 20 minutes or more; or

b) complete closure of a local distributor (e.g. Pokfulam Road, Salisbury Road, Clear Water Bay Road) in one direction for 20 minutes or more.

Some examples reported in the Law and order situation in Hong Kong in 2024 (Ends/Tuesday, February 11, 2025. Issued at HKT 19:14):

1. Homicide

 **	**A total of 19 cases of homicide were recorded, a drop of 32.1% compared with 2023. Ten of the cases involved domestic or family violence, while the other nine cases involved disputes (five cases), dangerous driving causing death (one case) and industrial accident (three cases). All of them were detected.

 **	**The figure for homicide was the third lowest since records began in 1969. Excluding the case concerning the industrial accident that happened on Anderson Road in 2022 and were later reclassified as “manslaughter” and included in the figure for 2024 upon receipt of legal advice from the Department of Justice, the figure for homicide in 2024 was in fact the lowest on record, and the detection rate reached 100%.

2. Wounding and serious assault

 **	**There were 3 614 cases of wounding and serious assault in total, registering a slight decrease of 0.6%, with 8.6% of the cases being triad-related. The number of cases was the lowest since 1973. The detection rate was 72.9%, the second highest since 1981.

3. Robbery

 **	**A total of 90 cases of robbery were registered, a drop of 7.2% compared with 2023 and the second lowest on record. The detection rate reached a record high of 92.2%. Over the past year, there were neither bank robbery cases nor robbery cases involving genuine firearms or stun guns. Two cases of watch and jewellery shop robbery were detected, one of which was resulted in an intelligence-led operation, with six persons arrested at the crime scene.

4. Burglary

 **	**There were 1 220 burglary cases in total, representing a decrease of 9.9% compared with 2023. The amount of losses also dropped by 25.5%. Similar to robbery, the number of burglary cases was the second lowest on record. The detection rate was 38%, which was the second highest on record.

 **	**The number of burglary cases experienced a dramatic reversal in 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the number of burglary cases recorded an increase of 56%, with the amount of losses rising by 30.3%, while the burglary cases involving village houses, which were hardest hit, even saw a 1.8-fold increase, reflecting a rather unfavourable situation. Hence, Police have undertaken extensive efforts to combat burglaries for almost a year in the past. These measures included strengthening intelligence gathering, stepping up patrols in high-risk areas, especially those with village houses, sustaining efforts to launch various crime prevention campaigns and share with members of the public the tips on enhancing home security through various channels to raise the awareness of burglary prevention, utilising drones and the Government Flying Service’s helicopters to carry out nighttime air patrols and search for burglars, as well as setting up roadblocks at different times and locations to stop and search suspicious vehicles or persons to increase the deterrent effect. As a result, the situation became better in the second half of 2024 and showed further improvement by the end of the year, with the full-year figure dropping by about 10% compared with 2023. Police will sustain efforts in this regard, and the Anti-crime Promotional Truck has just toured the whole city for two consecutive weeks before the Chinese New Year to educate members of the public about the importance and effective methods of burglary prevention.

5. Theft

 **	**There were 22 433 theft cases, representing a decrease of 3% compared with 2023. Among them, only shop theft recorded an increase (8 764 cases, +543 cases, +6.6%). Theft cases rose by 26.7% in 2023 and continued to increase by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2024. However, the situation improved steadily in the second half of 2024. Similar to burglary, theft shifted from an upward trend to a decline for the year as well. Among them, the figures for snatching (64 cases), theft from vehicle (540 cases) and missing motor vehicles (389 vehicles) even reached their lowest levels on record.

6. Blackmail

 **	**There were 3 031 cases of blackmail, an increase of 372 cases (+14%), with the majority of the increase coming from “naked chat”, which recorded 2 434 cases in total, a rise of 317 cases (+15%). Students remained the largest group of victims, but their proportion among victims had continued to improve, dropping from 34.5% in 2021 to 18.7% in 2024. Police will continue to strengthen the work in prevention of youth crime.

7. Sexual offences

 **	**There were 77 rape cases, an increase of 10 cases (+14.9%). The detection rate was 97.4%. One case involved a stranger and it was detected.

 **	**A total of 1 185 cases of indecent assault were recorded, a slight increase of 2%. 58.2% of the cases occurred in public places and MTR premises. The detection rate was 77%.

8. Serious drug offences

 **	**There were 1 114 serious drug cases, a decrease of 3.4% (-39 cases). The number of youths arrested in connection with serious drug cases had dropped by 27.5% (-49 persons) to 129 persons, of whom 31 persons were students, a drop of 35.4% (-17 persons).

 **	**The number of youths involved in serious drug cases has been steadily declining since its peak in 2021 (430 persons). By the end of 2024, the cumulative decrease had reached 70%, with the decline in the number of students arrested being more significant than that of non-students arrested, showing a cumulative drop of 76.9%. However, there was a noticeable increase in the use of e-cigarettes for consumption of "space oil drug" in 2024. According to the provisional figures from the Government Laboratory, as at December 31, 2024, Police had detected 195 related cases and arrested 278 persons in total, including 61 youths.

 **	**To target “space oil drug” trafficking, particularly the drug trafficking on the Internet and social media, Police conducted a number of intelligence-led operations in the second half of 2024, including Operation AMBERFLOCK executed in November in which a total of 99 persons were arrested, including 12 youths with the youngest aged 12, while drugs of various kinds were also seized, including 1.7 litres of suspected liquid etomidate, 1.2 kilograms of suspected etomidate powder and nearly 10 000 suspected “space oil drug” capsules.

 **	**In response to the latest drug trends and the upcoming commencement of legislative amendments relating to “space oil drug”, Police have started using Etomidate Rapid Test Kits since January 18 this year. This enables frontline officers who suspect individuals of possessing “space oil drug” to conduct on-site rapid tests using the test kits, thereby assisting officers in law enforcement.

 **	**In addition to enforcement actions, Police remain committed to the anti-drug education work. Apart from incorporating the information about “space oil drug” into school talks and the "interactive anti-drugs drama", Police have also disseminated infographics and new short videos on “space oil drug” to all schools in Hong Kong for showing to their students. The fourth cohort of the Leadership Institute on Narcotics (L.I.O.N.) has also kicked off officially, with 100 new young anti-drug leaders recruited.

3. Health incidents

Definition: Large-scale outbreaks of infectious disease or other health crises where public behaviour directly impacts containment.

Real Cases:

COVID-19 Pandemic (Emergency Alert)

[https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202305/30/P2023053000479.htm?fontSize=1](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202305/30/P2023053000479.htm?fontSize=1)

Key examples include:

Lockdowns & Restriction-testing Declarations: Alerts were sent to specific buildings or areas designated for compulsory testing and lockdowns, legally requiring residents to stay home until tested.

Critical Policy Announcements: Used to announce the rollout of key measures, such as the launch of the Vaccine Pass scheme, ensuring the message reached virtually everyone instantly.

Other Major Outbreaks (Potential Use): The system could be deployed for a severe outbreak of a new infectious disease (e.g., a dangerous strain of avian flu) to direct the public to vaccination centres or announce urgent public health measures.

Rapid spread of Seasonal influenza:

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 9) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP also reminded members of the public that the local influenza activity has further increased over the past week, indicating that Hong Kong has entered the summer influenza season.
