CANT FIND RELEVANT DESCRIPTION


how it run,

EAS uses cell broadcast service technology to disseminate EAS messages. Mobile service users can receive EAS messages via compatible mobile devices connected to local mobile networks.

Mobile devices enabled to receive EAS messages will generate an audio alarm signal together with vibration for about ten seconds to alert users of reception of an EAS message. Notification will also pop up on the screen.

There are two alert levels for EAS messages, namely "Extreme Emergency Alert" and "Emergency Alert". Government Bureau or Department that disseminates the EAS message will designate the alert level according to the urgency or severity of the circumstances in question.

Not all mobile devices are capable of receiving alert. The most recent mobile device or those not bought in HK may not be ok.
