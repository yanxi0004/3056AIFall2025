## Working Title: "Optimizing Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System: From Underutilized Infrastructure to Effective Public Service"

---

## I. Introduction

### Background Context

* Emergency Alert System historical use
* Government investment in EAS
* Regional and international approaches (e.g. Japan, UK) to mass emergency notification

### Problem Identification

Following comprehensive analysis of Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System, this paper identifies critical underutilization issues that waste public resources while failing to maximize public safety potential through effective emergency preparation.

Central Argument: Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System constitutes a poor investment of public resources due to severe underutilization, a lack of cost transparency, and a failure to adopt optimization strategies—such as regular testing for public familiarity or revenue-generating applications—that could improve both its effectiveness and fiscal efficiency.

## II. Methodology

### Research Approach

This study employs a public infrastructure efficiency analysis framework combining:

#### Primary Sources:

* CEO: Government budget (i.e. maintenance fee, operational cost) documents and infrastructure investment records; Which specific government department or office holds the primary responsibility for authorising and deciding the content of messages to be disseminated via the EAS?
* Back-up procedure when there is unforeseen disaster
* Security Bureau: Beyond activating the EAS, what are the standard operating procedures and contingency plans that the government follows during a major emergency? What specific follow-up actions are typically taken?
* the government's official expectations or guidelines for citizen conduct upon receiving an emergency alert? (e.g., seek further information from a specific source, take immediate protective action, etc.)

ie Reply from government email

#### Secondary Sources:

* International emergency alert system implementation studies and usage patterns (Japan, UK, US usage situation)
* Academic research on emergency communication effectiveness and public infrastructure optimization
* Industry analysis of telecommunications infrastructure dual-use applications
* Public administration literature on government asset utilization and revenue generation財政報告
* Legislative Council discussions on emergency preparedness and communication infrastructure
* Newspaper about Hongkongers shocked by 'emergency' alert on phones
* Messages sent from the old system

#### Analytical Framework:

(Based on policy objectives, we evaluate these few aspects and develop arguments)

Policy objectives

* Protect the safety and well-being of people: Emergency Preparedness Evaluation - Assessing the government's internal and public-facing emergency procedures and follow-up actions.
* Cost-effectiveness of government resources: Assessment of infrastructure investment vs. actual utilization and public benefit
* Intragovernmental coordination
* Refer to international benchmarking for betterment of social safety:  Systematic comparison with emergency alert systems in other countries (Japan, UK, US, Singapore [cell-broadcast apps] usage situation)
* Infrastructure Optimization: Analysis of dual-use potential and revenue generation opportunities

## III. Main Findings + Arguments

### Finding 1: Severe System Underutilization → low cost efficiency

* High operation and maintenance fee of EAS

Argument 1: The Emergency Alert System's minimal usage represents inefficient public resource allocation that fails to deliver proportional public safety benefits relative to infrastructure investment and maintenance costs.

### Finding 2: Hidden Infrastructure Costs and Transparency Gaps

(If without disclosure of costs…)

* Annual maintenance and operational expenses not readily available in public documentation
* Infrastructure specifications and technical capability details are lacking public transparency
* Absence of cost-effectiveness evaluation or public justification for continued investment
* Unknown corresponding department held liability to the actual operation

Arg 2: Government's failure to provide transparent reporting on Emergency Alert System costs and utilization prevents proper public accountability and evidence-based infrastructure policy evaluation.

### Finding 3: Insufficient and unclear emergency preparation from government (if gov reply not satisfactory)

* Vague definition for emergency in gov (e.g. not used in extreme weather)
* Unknown current preparation for emergency situations (eg. Time to send EAS message, any follow-up after emergencies…)

Argument 3: Insufficient and unclear emergency preparation from government

### Finding 4: International Best Practice Gaps

* Significantly higher utilization rates in comparable emergency alert systems globally
* More flexible activation criteria and broader definition of public safety emergencies
* Integration with weather services, health alerts, and public safety communications
* Effective system testing and follow-up guidelines for EAS in other countries

Arg 4: Strategic expansion of system use for weather warnings, health alerts, and public safety communications would improve both system effectiveness and cost justification while maintaining emergency readiness.

### Finding 5: Revenue Generation and Optimization Opportunities

* Potential for dual-use applications during non-emergency periods
* Commercial infrastructure sharing possibilities without compromising emergency functionality
* Models from other jurisdictions successfully generating revenue from emergency infrastructure

Arg 5: Commercial applications during non-emergency periods could offset maintenance costs while improving system reliability and public familiarity without compromising emergency communication capability.

## IV. Call for Action

### Immediate System Optimization Recommendations

#### 1. Enhanced Utilization Framework Development

* Expanded Activation Criteria: Develop broader but appropriate criteria for weather warnings, health alerts, and public safety communications
* Regular System Testing: Implement regular public testing with valuable information delivery to maintain system readiness and public familiarity (cite news on public panic after 1st EAS message)
* Integration Strategy: Coordinate with Hong Kong Observatory, Department of Health, and other agencies for comprehensive alert system utilization
* Public-Private Partnership: Explore partnerships for infrastructure sharing that maintain emergency capability while generating operational revenue →relieve financial burden

#### 2. Transparency and Accountability Measures

* Cost Reporting: Implement regular public reporting on system maintenance costs, usage statistics, and cost-effectiveness analysis
* Performance Metrics: Establish clear criteria for measuring system effectiveness and public benefit delivery
* Public Consultation: Engage citizens in determining appropriate uses and priorities for emergency communication infrastructure

#### 3. System Integration and Enhancement

* Multi-Agency Coordination: Establish protocols for system use by multiple government agencies for appropriate public communications
* Technology Upgrade: Evaluate opportunities for enhancing system capability and cost-effectiveness through technology improvements
* Regional Coordination: Explore cooperation with Mainland China and regional partners for enhanced emergency communication capability

4. Revenue Generation and Infrastructure Optimization

* Dual-Use Assessment: Conduct comprehensive evaluation of commercial application potential during non-emergency periods
* Public-Private Partnership: Explore partnerships for infrastructure sharing that maintain emergency capability while generating operational revenue
* International Learning: Study successful models of emergency infrastructure optimization and revenue generation

### Legislative and Policy Action Required

* Emergency communication utilization standards and activation criteria framework
* Public infrastructure transparency and reporting requirements
* Revenue generation guidelines for government infrastructure during non-primary-use periods

### ？Implementation Timeline

Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Comprehensive system cost analysis and utilization framework development Phase 2 (Months 4-9): Pilot expanded use program with weather and public safety integration

Phase 3 (Months 10-18): Revenue generation pilot and commercial application assessment

Phase 4 (Ongoing): Full optimization implementation with regular evaluation and public reporting

### Outline for Letter to the Editor

the government says the alert system will be used to send messages to mobile phone users “during unforeseen emergency situations that may cause territory-wide/large-scale outage of critical infrastructure or extensively endanger lives and properties”

### (around 200 words; need 2 weeks to publish)

Focus 1: Learning from International Experience: How should Hong Kong handle emergencies like these if they occur? Eg. Child trafficking, knife attacks.

Compare with counterparts in other countries to know better usage of EAS, suggest better use of the system. E.g. Other countries’ disaster preparation, categories of different types of incidents? If no Internet?

 (Deadline: mid October sen out, aim Early November publish, 5th anniversary of launch of EAS)

Focus 2: To what extent and in what way the govt./city is prepared for unforeseen emergency situations that may cause territory-wide/large-scale outage of critical infrastructure or extensively endanger lives and properties? Does Hong Kong have any mechanisms or preparations for emergencies?

(if Internet has problem) (wait for government reply first) (hopefully, post in late Nov)

If the internet is down, are there any other mediums that can be used to send warnings/ tackle the urgent situation ? The government needs to prepare for unlikely scenarios.

1. Opening Hook: State the Problem Directly

* Mention the public's surprise and confusion during the first EAS test.
* Pose a question: "Why does such a sophisticated system sit idle?"

2. State the Core Argument: Wasted Potential

* Point out the significant public investment in the EAS.
* State that its extreme underuse is a waste of resources and a missed opportunity for public safety.

3. Provide the Solution: Learn from Others & Test Regularly

* Suggest learning from other cities (e.g., Tokyo, London) that use alerts for weather, traffic, and public health.
* Advocate for regular, scheduled tests to build public familiarity and reduce panic.

4. Call to Action: Urge for Transparency and Optimization

* Call on the government to:
  * Publish the system's costs and usage statistics.
  * Expand its use beyond extreme emergencies.
  * Implement a clear public education plan.

5. Closing Statement: A Smarter Investment

* Conclude by stating that an used alert system is a prepared city. Optimizing the EAS is a smart step for Hong Kong's safety and resilience.
