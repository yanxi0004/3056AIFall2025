To okay. So, emergency road system. Do you have any idea anything you want to pursue

questions regarding the system, right? So I think the starting point is you can read the two letters we already published. Okay? So there's one letter we're basically talking about the funding and talking about it's being underused, right? So since the launch of the new system, it has been used once only. So that's clearly a problem, a sign of the problem. And the second letter, we talk about when we should use the system so we start being more constructive. The first letter is quite critical, right? Because we feel like the whoever requested money was not doing it in a very honest way. They didn't disclose all the information to the lawmakers. Now the second the second letter was, start proposing something okay. Now for for this new project, I think the immediate thing we can do is to ask about maintenance, ask about maintenance fee, and also ask about some something about the infrastructure, because we know a little bit about they actually build a lot of towers to send the signals around you. Sammy, so, so we need to learn more about the physical infrastructure and also the maintenance fee. If, if we got a figure, even if just a couple million, that's still a big deal, right? So, so, so I think that's already an area to to explore, to to look at the recurrent cost of the of the system, and also start looking at the actual power, actual infrastructure hardware of the system. And then we need to explore how the system can be put in use. Because the fact is that it hasn't been used for many years, is what I mean. So the question now is, how can we make more use of it? One possibility is to rent it to some companies. If there's some infrastructure, some some hardware, maybe we share with them. So when, when it's not in use, for, for emergency alert, we can, we can share the we can maybe, maybe at least they can share the maintenance course, right? Or even we can get some money back so that that will be one but, but I don't know whether, whether it's it's feasible at all, we will have to do a bit of investigation. And then another direction is to look at how the system was used in other countries, because Hong Kong is not the only place where we have this system, right? So we start, well, actually in the second letter, there's already a little bit discussion on the UK case. But then we can go further. We can look at other countries. So that will be another direction to look at. And ultimately, if you want to, you want to do a very advanced job for this project, then we have to start thinking about how we can prepare the city for emergency. Because preparing a city for emergency is a very complex and advanced engineering project. You see me, because there are all kinds of emergency you have to prepare for the city and to have a lot of system that's just one piece of the puzzle. So there's many other things that have to come together in order to help the city to survive a major emergency or disaster or whatever. I mean, we are very good at extreme weather. You know, observatory. We have signal system for for typhoon and for, you know, bad weather, heavy rain. But do we have other system in place to prepare the city for other extreme events? Is that? Me, so? So, I think that's a broader question. If you want to explore, you can want, you may want to look into that, but that's actually a separate it could be a separate project. It's it's actually a larger issue, but you can start, start thinking, thinking about any, any questions on uh, physical

infrastructure, yeah, so I think before you raise the question, you need to do a bit more research. You want to maybe ask AI or do some Google Scholar search and to learn more about how the whole thing is working. So like, what would it take to actually send a message to 6 million or even more devices in just a matter of two or three minutes? So that's an engineering problem. So, so you have to ask around and try to figure out what, what kind of infrastructure is required for this kind of accomplishment. And then you can, you can start thinking about, just have some idea, you know, how the infrastructure might be leveraged for other purposes, right? And also there might be the use case of sending message to devices in a specific region, instead of everybody, whether that is possible, and also whether that is useful. Okay? So these are all the some possible directions, okay, so like getting using the site, yeah, like site specific search? Yeah, I think if you, if you search legislative council website. Now there's more documents on this topic. There's new, new information that you can read.

Figure out the right keyword to figure out, yeah, the.
