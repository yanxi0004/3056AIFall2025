# Discussion Notes - Emergency Alert System Project

## Project Overview

Wang, okay, so basically, we talk about emergency system here, and our project will be looking at to what extent and in what ways the Hong Kong government is well prepared for the kind of unforeseen emergency, if disaster or event that would critically affect the infrastructure, such as Internet, and also threaten the lives of the people in Hong Kong.

## Infrastructure Investment and Challenges

And obviously, this money has been spent to build the physical infrastructure so such a message can be sent to millions of devices very quickly. But the question becomes whether the government has got a well established mechanism to decide what kind of message should be sent to the people, and how the people are expected to respond to such messages in the event of such disasters.

And apparently, we do not know about this at all. And the OFCA, the Office of the communication authorities, they are not in a position to make such decisions. Their job is simply to run the system and take orders to send the messages using the system, but some other bureaus or senior officers of the Hong Kong governments, they are supposed to make such critical decision.

## The Challenge of Unforeseen Emergencies

But the challenge here is that the government says that this is the kind of unforeseen emergency disaster. So by definition, this is something that is very hard to anticipate or expect or foresee. But given that we already made a significant amount of money and investment to build infrastructure, the physical system to send a message, then I think we should also have a the so called the soft system, that would enable the government to actually benefit from the infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Failure Scenarios

So that means, to be more specific, we need to consider the case of when the internet infrastructure is not working, because if the internet is intact, then messages can be sent around through the internet, then there's no need to activate or use the emergency allowance system, but when the Internet is down, then the whole city will have to be prepared and to deal with this kind of infrastructure issue or disaster in a very different way that people are generally not ready.

So that's why we need to have a plan. The government needs to have a plan. And the government also needs to prepare the people for such unforeseeable events, even though it's very unlikely, even though it's the probability of such event is very low, it's still worth the time and investment to provide the kind of training and prepare the public for this kind of event.

## Two-Letter Strategy

So that could be one central argument that we can make, but that actually could be the second letter, but the first letter would be more about just to look at how other countries are designing and running their system, how they are trying to leverage the system in a more systematic way.

For example, there will be a classification or categorization of the kind of message that can be sent out. Look at the United States, look at some other countries. And even though children kidnapping, human trafficking is very rare here in Hong Kong, even just for one case that could happen in every five or 10 years, we should still be prepared, right?

So we need to contact the police or security bureau and ask them how they handle the kind of cases that other people other countries would handle using Emergency Alert System, and whether the government has similar plan to start activating emergency alert system under similar cases or circumstances.

So by looking at other countries practices and lessons, we can make the argument that the Emergency Alert System should be leveraged in a more proactive way here in Hong Kong.

## Timeline and Publication Strategy

So I would say we submit the first letter in the early the first week of November, because November is the fifth anniversary of the system, the launch of the system, and then we submit the second letter after the first letter is published. And hopefully the second letter will be published in the late November.

So in November, there will be two letters on the system, and that will be good enough to hopefully increase people's awareness, and there will be more conversation about this system.
