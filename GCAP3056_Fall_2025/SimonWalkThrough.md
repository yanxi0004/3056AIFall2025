00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:19.939
Simon Wang: Alright, so, in this video, I'm going to talk about, you know, this reflective learn… reflective essay that, you're expected to write. So, if you remember what, we, discussed at the beginning of this course,

2
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:28.350
Simon Wang: There are a total of 5 essays you have to write. It's actually quite short. We're talking about just around 200 words.

3
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:41.029
Simon Wang: So it's, not really that much of, writing to do. In fact, I would, expect you to, talk to an AI chatbot, and, the chatbot will.

4
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.180
Simon Wang: basically write the essay for you.

5
00:00:45.670 --> 00:01:00.000
Simon Wang: And the chat history will be sent to us, so if you enter your email address at the end of the chat, you will get a copy of the chat history, and I will also get a copy of the chat history.

6
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:10.489
Simon Wang: the idea of, writing this kind of essay is actually, kind of help you to explore a new way of writing, so instead of just,

7
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:26.619
Simon Wang: just you, you know, thinking about what to write and try to write, you will have an AI chap or an AI buddy, to talk to you, and, through negotiation, through AI human communication.

8
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.930
Simon Wang: the text will be generated. So, this is,

9
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:45.789
Simon Wang: I think it's kind of similar to vibe coding. You don't really have to write the codes, but you talk to AI, and you need to share your insights. And then the text will be generated just like the codes will be generated.

10
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.320
Simon Wang: Okay, so what really matters is your insights, is your critical thinking and original thinking.

11
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.029
Simon Wang: Alright, so that's the… that's the premise of this, assignment.

12
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:12.990
Simon Wang: Now, what you need to do is to, take a look at this, Reflective Essay 1. There's a whole page which I have updated, so you can see this page is very similar to the,

13
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.680
Simon Wang: Moodle Post.

14
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:34.529
Simon Wang: Alright, so you, you can find either page, that, that would be good enough, because here you got all the details, about this particular essay, and including the deadline, it's coming Sunday, 11pm. So, I would say you probably want to spend…

15
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:50.870
Simon Wang: maybe around 10 minutes, just to figure out what you have to do. But then, more importantly, you want to spend at least, half an hour to review, all the notes you have taken, and, you know, the… in the past,

16
00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:06.849
Simon Wang: 5 weeks, you know, what you have learned from this course, and reflect on this a little bit, alright? And also think about the project you are working on, just, you know, gather some ideas, and then you'll be ready.

17
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:25.510
Simon Wang: to talk to, the AI, chatbot. Now, the AI chatbot that we, designed is not a generic chatbot, so you can talk to Pearl, you can talk to the HKBU AI platform. Those are the general chatbot, right? So, so they can…

18
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:35.880
Simon Wang: talk to you, answer your questions, but they don't really know what you're working on. But, if you click here, which is to launch the Reflective SA AI Tutor.

19
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:50.569
Simon Wang: you will reach, a page that will offer you a little bit more, kind of, background information, but that's really not too much different from the Moodle forum here, or this page.

20
00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:00.190
Simon Wang: But anyway, you can go through this, and then you click on Start Writing Session right here, or you can just, go straight to

21
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.360
Simon Wang: This page.

22
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.700
Simon Wang: Now, this is where you need to,

23
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.720
Simon Wang: Do a little bit of housekeeping to set things up, so you have to… like…

24
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.790
Simon Wang: come to this page, so you have to log in to your, HKBU, email account.

25
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:34.869
Simon Wang: to visit the GenAI platform, and through this link, you will be able to, generate the API key. Now, if you don't know what is the API key, that's okay, you know, you don't have to know it.

26
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.619
Simon Wang: But if you are curious, you can always talk to your AI. AI should explain to you what is API.

27
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.630
Simon Wang: But anyway, so you got your key, and you put it here, and then you click connect, alright? So you will see it's being connected.

28
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.089
Simon Wang: And once it is connected.

29
00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:08.029
Simon Wang: there's actually some welcome greeting prompt that, will show up here, and in fact, you can close this sidebar, so there's a little bit more space. And, you read through it, and you click OK.

30
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:22.679
Simon Wang: Alright? So, once you click OK, the chatbot will start talking to you, like, and basically the chatbot will ask you about your team project, or something like that, and then you can start saying, oh,

31
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:41.029
Simon Wang: you know, we are questioning the, Hong Kong Observatory's decision on… When to announce… the decision to hoist.

32
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.670
Simon Wang: signal… Number 8… Typho.

33
00:05:49.210 --> 00:06:01.729
Simon Wang: Or something like that, right? So, yeah, so you talk to the chat board, and you go back and forth, right? And you keep doing that.

34
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.659
Simon Wang: A little bit, so I think we need to talk a little bit more.

35
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.380
Simon Wang: So you can say something like, they have… winked.

36
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.449
Simon Wang: stations… To monitor the wind strings.

37
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.419
Simon Wang: Or something like that. Okay. So, yeah, so, so, so you, so you just, you just keep talking.

38
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:43.659
Simon Wang: Right, so, and you can say something, my primary concern… Is that, they may… Make the…

39
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.989
Simon Wang: announcement. Too early.

40
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.990
Simon Wang: tube,

41
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:58.120
Simon Wang: make the accurate predictions or something. Well, the thing is, I'm just doing a demo. What you need to do is actually

42
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:12.079
Simon Wang: hopefully you will be engaged in a more in-depth, critical, discussion with the chatbot, right? Because just treat your chatbot as your buddy, or as your tutor.

43
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:22.650
Simon Wang: and you want to demonstrate some original and critical thinking, and share some insights, about what you have learned. Because, remember.

44
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:30.460
Simon Wang: In the past, 5 weeks, especially the first, 4 weeks, we actually,

45
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:39.879
Simon Wang: studied a couple of, like, two specific math models, right? Regression and simulation. So, you need to, go back to the notes.

46
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:52.879
Simon Wang: And, and also the, there's an in-class exercise, which, basically, you, you only think about what are the tools that we have, we have developed, we have picked up.

47
00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:01.370
Simon Wang: And how these models can be applied to the project, right? Because last, yesterday, actually,

48
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:15.850
Simon Wang: we, we discussed the projects. So, think of this exercise as a kind of warm-up before you actually do the project, alright? So, you want to engage in this a little bit more.

49
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:22.170
Simon Wang: So… Okay, kind of,

50
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:29.540
Simon Wang: Not sure yet. But, we'd like to…

51
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:45.610
Simon Wang: raise some questions for the HKO staff to answer, like, weather… They can justify the signal.

52
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:56.609
Simon Wang: Number 8. You know, based all… the real… winged data.

53
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.359
Simon Wang: So, so, so you just keep going, right?

54
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:21.919
Simon Wang: So, and then you can see the tutor will start explore… exploring with you different math models, and so on and so forth. And then you can say, I need to write…

55
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.750
Simon Wang: A, 200-word reflective essay.

56
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.099
Simon Wang: Can you suggest an online?

57
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:48.340
Simon Wang: Okay, so you see there's the 200 words, there's an outline, and so on and so forth, and, and, you can say, oh, we'll…

58
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.100
Simon Wang: Come back to this.

59
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.850
Simon Wang: But, can you draft an essay?

60
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.529
Simon Wang: For demo purposes.

61
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.989
Simon Wang: Right, so… so there's actually,

62
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.410
Simon Wang: There's, there's actually a, a,

63
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:30.070
Simon Wang: essay being drafted, but as you can see, this essay does not have much substance, because throughout the conversation, I didn't really share much insights, right? My main purpose here is just to demonstrate. But when you talk to the chat board.

64
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.549
Simon Wang: You should, try to, you know, share more insights.

65
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:42.309
Simon Wang: With, with the travel about your perspective, about your experience. So, so you need to really do some reflection.

66
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.029
Simon Wang: And perhaps another tip would be useful, you know.

67
00:10:47.480 --> 00:11:04.270
Simon Wang: I'm sure that other teachers of other courses also ask you to do reflection, and you may wonder, you know, what am I supposed to do? Right? So, I would suggest you to think about learning, right? Because what we care about is

68
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:14.080
Simon Wang: is your learning experience, and whether you learn something from this course. So, what is learning? And, for me, learning is, at the most fundamental level.

69
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:27.129
Simon Wang: a permanent change of behaviors, right? So, and of course, if you only change your behavior, you have to change your mindset. You have to change the way you look at the world.

70
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.119
Simon Wang: So, essentially, what we're looking for is, you know.

71
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:40.010
Simon Wang: Maybe when you're given a problem, or when you're given a situation, you're going to behave in certain ways.

72
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:58.840
Simon Wang: before taking the course, right? But now, after taking the course, you're going to behave differently, right? So, for example, you don't… you won't probably even pay attention to the locations of bus stops, right? And, you don't really know that,

73
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:05.230
Simon Wang: Real-time data of bus arrival, of a given bus stop could be…

74
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:13.640
Simon Wang: accessed through writing the program, right? So, after this course, you know that.

75
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:24.329
Simon Wang: And, you will do things differently, right? So that's the kind of, changing behaviors or changing mindset that, we hope

76
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:31.480
Simon Wang: will happen to you, right? And, essentially what you need to do is to think about,

77
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:46.809
Simon Wang: are there any kind of opportunities for you to learn, so you will change the way you do things, or change the way you think about things? Right? So I think that's kind of a more, like, conceptual level thinking.

78
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:59.439
Simon Wang: In terms of what is learning, and what is the kind of reflection you want to do. Because through reflection, through looking at your past experience, you will be able to see whether there's any change in behaviors.

79
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:17.659
Simon Wang: Alright, yeah, so, so, and, and, and, and then you can click here, which is the green check button, and you can put your email. You see, you have to wait a little bit, because the whole chat history will be sent to AI again, and the, the AI will,

80
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:27.620
Simon Wang: give you a little bit of the points. But, don't… don't trust this report, because it's probably just over, over-generous.

81
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:35.029
Simon Wang: I need to fix the prompt, you know, because ultimately the teacher will have to make decisions on

82
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:52.720
Simon Wang: In terms of the actual grades, okay? Right, so… and then you can put your email, because when you close the browser, everything will be gone, right? So you, you, you send… you can send the report, but at the same time, you can download a copy.

83
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.549
Simon Wang: you can download a copy of, like, Markdown.

84
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.700
Simon Wang: Coming's not working.

85
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.040
Simon Wang: Hmm.

86
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:24.399
Simon Wang: I don't know. I think it should work, but apparently it's not working, so we'll figure this out. But basically, I think the send report should work.

87
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:51.190
Simon Wang: Oh, actually, yeah, so, so if you, if you got a copy text, you actually will get a, report, okay? I don't know why the download button is not working, but, you should be able to send this.

88
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.390
Simon Wang: Okay.

89
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:10.239
Simon Wang: And then, yeah, that's, that's about it. Okay, so I hope, I hope you enjoyed this process, but, do let us know if you have any questions or feedback. And the thing is.

90
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.770
Simon Wang: What, what you need to do… Is to actually reply here.

91
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:25.440
Simon Wang: Okay, so, actually, you need to reply, in the Moodle forum here.

92
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.070
Simon Wang: Hold on, just one second.

93
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.230
Simon Wang: Right, so…

94
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.260
Simon Wang: Right, so this is, this is, this is the, the information page.

95
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.820
Simon Wang: But, in fact, If you go down here…

96
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:02.119
Simon Wang: there's this forum post, so basically you want to reply, okay? The way you… you want to submit…

97
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.270
Simon Wang: your essay.

98
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.820
Simon Wang: is to reply, okay?

99
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.990
Simon Wang: So when you reply, you put…

100
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:23.099
Simon Wang: your essay. But, I would actually, encourage you to explore how, you might generate a, a, HTML version.

101
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:31.010
Simon Wang: So, that would look a bit nicer. So, you can say something like, you can go back to talk to the chatbot.

102
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:46.159
Simon Wang: So you can say something like, can you generate an HTML code for me to reply to the…

103
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:52.570
Simon Wang: Moodle Forum to present my essay.

104
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:58.790
Simon Wang: Something like that. Because, actually…

105
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.029
Simon Wang: We will take that into consideration, alright?

106
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:12.210
Simon Wang: Well, actually, this… this code, I don't know why it still says,

107
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:22.450
Simon Wang: 100 words, it should be 200 words. I need to fix this a little bit, but… but I think, I think you get the idea, right? So, basically…

108
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:30.929
Simon Wang: I mean, I mean, you can talk to another AI, you can go to the GitHub compiler to ask for, kind of,

109
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.040
Simon Wang: more sophisticated HTML codes.

110
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.590
Simon Wang: And then you come here.

111
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:43.649
Simon Wang: you will be able to basically reply, and you can put the HTML codes here.

112
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:52.120
Simon Wang: Alright, so that's, that's how… that's how you will be able to write, and a reflective assay, alright.
