We need to revise the letter that will be sent to the HKO staff 

latest version

I hope this email finds you well. We are students from Baptist University. As a regular user of the “Dr. Tin” chatbot service, I appreciate its interactive features and accessibility in providing meteorological information; however, given the rising frequency of extreme weather events, I believe the system requires urgent upgrades to better meet public expectations for real-time alerts and modern AI capabilities. As a university student interested in public service technology, I am writing to seek further information regarding the chatbot’s development and performance. To aid our understanding, we seek your clarification on the following points:

1. Could you please provide the current spreadsheet for the Dr. Tin chatbot?

2. Could you please provide the number of users for the Dr. Tin chatbot in August 2022, August 2023, August 2024, and August 2025?

3. Could you please provide the visitor numbers for the HKO website and mobile app in August 2022, August 2023, August 2024, and August 2025? If these data are unavailable, could you provide an analysis of relevant user engagement metrics?

4. Regarding the formal evaluations of 'Dr. Tin' over the past three years, were key metrics such as 'intent recognition accuracy' and its 'ability to handle out-of-scope queries' (i.e., unclassifiable questions) measured?  How does the analysis of these out-of-intent recognition inform system improvements?


5. Are there plans to upgrade "Dr. Tin" to a Large Language Model (LLM) or hybrid model, and if so, could you share the expected timeline and enhancements for this upgrade?

6. Are there any planned upgrades to the chatbot's technology, and if yes, is it intended that these upgrades will be subject to a public tender?

7. It seems that Dr Tin is not just a chatbot. He also participates in some educational online games, e.g., https://kids.weather.gov.hk/tc/concentration.html ... Please provide more info about HKO's overall plan for Dr Tin.

8. Why can't Dr. Tin provide intelligent analysis of HKO's 52+ datasets instead of simply redirecting users to external links

9. In 2022, HKO stated Dr. Tin would be improved 'subject to available resources.' What specific upgrades have been implemented since then, beyond the original 145+ predefined intent structure?"
