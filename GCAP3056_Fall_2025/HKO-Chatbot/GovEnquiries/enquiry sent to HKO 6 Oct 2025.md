Subject: Data and information request- Questions about Dr Tin Chatbot

Dear Sir/Madam, 

I hope this email finds you well. I am from Baptist University. As a regular user of the “Dr. Tin” chatbot service, I appreciate its interactive features and accessibility in providing meteorological information. As a university student interested in public service technology, I am writing to seek further information regarding the chatbot’s development and performance. To aid our understanding, we seek your clarification on the following points:

  

1.        Could you please provide the latest version of the data spreadsheet for the Dr. Tin chatbot? We currently hold the 2022 iteration and require the most recent dataset for comparative analysis.

  

2.        ⁠We kindly request the user engagement metrics for the Dr. Tin chatbot across August 2022, August 2023, August 2024, and August 2025. Note that historical data beyond 2022 is unavailable in public sources. Could you confirm whether this dataset has been compiled or if projections are feasible for the 2024–2025 periods?

  

3.        ⁠Could you supply the visitor counts for the HKO website and mobile application during August 2022, August 2023, August 2024, and August 2025? We acknowledge that app-specific user metrics were previously unavailable in 2022. Is this limitation now resolved? Should these figures remain inaccessible, we would appreciate an analysis of user engagement ( e,g, visitors count between month, user review rate)

  

4.        4. Regarding the formal evaluations of 'Dr. Tin' over the past three years, were key metrics such as 'intent recognition accuracy' and its 'ability to handle out-of-scope queries' (i.e., unclassifiable questions) measured?  How does the analysis of these out-of-intent recognition inform system improvements? [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ef9ot2gBax6Oi5uzfh-R0_xZATvStuK4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106056444220589955468&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ef9ot2gBax6Oi5uzfh-R0_xZATvStuK4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106056444220589955468&rtpof=true&sd=true "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ef9ot2gBax6Oi5uzfh-R0_xZATvStuK4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106056444220589955468&rtpof=true&sd=true") 

  

  

5.        Regarding plans to upgrade "Dr. Tin" to a Large Language Model (LLM) or a hybrid model (a system that combines the reliability of rule-based responses for critical weather data with the flexibility of an LLM for complex queries), could you share the expected timeline, key enhancements, and clarify if such technological upgrades will be subject to a public tender process?

6.        In 2022, HKO stated Dr. Tin would be improved 'subject to available resources.' What specific upgrades have been implemented since then, beyond the original 145+ predefined intent structure (e.g., [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ef9ot2gBax6Oi5uzfh-R0_xZATvStuK4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106056444220589955468&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ef9ot2gBax6Oi5uzfh-R0_xZATvStuK4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106056444220589955468&rtpof=true&sd=true "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ef9ot2gBax6Oi5uzfh-R0_xZATvStuK4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106056444220589955468&rtpof=true&sd=true")

  

7.        Dr. Tin serves as HKO's mascot beyond the chatbot, appearing in educational tools like online weather quizzes (with badge rewards), the 'Cloud Appreciation by Dr. Tin' e-book (featuring interactive cloud games), and kid-oriented sites such as [kids.weather.gov.hk](http://kids.weather.gov.hk/ "http://kids.weather.gov.hk"). Drawing from HKO's 2022–2026 Strategic Plan (e.g., AI for public services and disaster education), LegCo budget papers (e.g., 2020–21 trial launches), and recent app updates (e.g., 2025 radar/voice enhancements), what are the specific plans for expanding Dr. Tin's role in interactive games, AI-driven climate education, and Greater Bay Area digital outreach—and how might these integrate with open datasets for personalized learning?"

  

8.        How can Dr. Tin be enhanced to provide intelligent analysis of HKO's 52+ datasets (e.g., integrating specific data like heat/UV indices, lightning counts, tropical cyclone tracks, smart lamppost sensors, and historical rainfall extremes, based on comparisons with the current spreadsheet's coverage of ~10-15 core feeds) instead of simply redirecting users to external links?

  

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

Tsz Tung
