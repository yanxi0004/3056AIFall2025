Duration of sunshine (King's Park):              1.3 H
The mean UV index recorded at King's Park yesterday was 2,
the UV intensity was LOW.
The maximum UV index for yesterday was 5.

Yesterday's (05 Oct 2025) average ambient gamma radiation
dose rate taken outdoors in Hong Kong ranged from 0.08 to
0.15 microsievert per hour.  These are within the normal
range of fluctuation of the background radiation level in
Hong Kong (See Note). The average dose rates measured at the
radiation monitoring stations over various parts of the
territory were as follows :

Station                     Yesterday's average
                            (microsievert/hour)
Ping Chau                           0.08
Tap Mun                             0.08
Kat O                               0.09
Yuen Ng Fan                         0.11
Tai Mei Tuk                         0.11
Sha Tau Kok                         0.10
Kwun Tong                           0.12
Sai Wan Ho                          0.08
King's Park                         0.15
Tsim Bei Tsui                       0.13
Cape D'Aguilar                      0.12
Chek Lap Kok                        0.15   


Note
1.     From readings taken at various locations in Hong Kong in the
       past, the hourly mean ambient gamma radiation dose rate may
       vary between 0.06 and 0.3 microsievert per hour. (1
       microsievert = 0.000001 sievert = 0.001 millisievert)

2.     Temporal variations are generally caused by changes in
       meteorological conditions such as rainfall, wind and
       barometric pressure.

3.     Spatial variations are generally caused by differences in
       the radioactive content of local rock and soil.

4.     The data displayed is provisional. Only limited data
       validation has been carried out.

5.     The range of relative humidity in the daily weather summary
       originates from the observer&#039;s reports of Hourly
       Readings of the day. This follows the long-term practice of
       collecting climatological data of the Hong Kong Observatory
       for over a century. It may differ from the relative humidity
       range derived from the 1-minute reports of the automatic
       weather station.
