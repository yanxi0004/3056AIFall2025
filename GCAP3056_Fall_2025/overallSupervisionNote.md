## PROJECT WORKFLOW FRAMEWORK

### Phase 1: Planning & Research Foundation
• **Start with outline development** - never rush into writing
• **Conduct systematic research** of publicly available sources
• **Take detailed notes** - don't just collect URLs
• **Identify information gaps** through thorough analysis
• **Plan before executing** - outline beats immediate writing

### Phase 2: Government Engagement
• **Complete public research first** - demonstrate you've done homework
• **Target specific departments** based on their expertise
• **Ask specific questions** - avoid vague information requests
• **Separate information gathering from advocacy** - maintain professional tone
• **Follow up systematically** - track responses and follow-up needs

### Phase 3: Analysis & Writing
• **Use structured outlines** with clear headings and sub-headings
• **Integrate research systematically** - connect sources to arguments
• **Document individual contributions** - track who did what
• **Revise based on feedback** - don't treat first draft as final

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Research Phase Errors
• **Superficial source review** - listing URLs without reading content
• **Inadequate note-taking** - missing key insights and data points
• **Rushing to writing** - skipping proper outline development
• **Poor planning** - not thinking deeply about argument structure

### Communication Issues
• **Vague feedback requests** - not specifying what help is needed
• **Unprofessional government correspondence** - mixing advocacy with information requests
• **Poor team coordination** - not documenting individual contributions
• **Inadequate follow-up** - not tracking progress or responses

### Documentation Problems
• **Missing contribution tracking** - unclear who did what work
• **Inconsistent file organization** - scattered information across platforms
• **Insufficient meeting summaries** - not processing discussion insights
• **Poor version control** - multiple drafts without clear progression

## FEEDBACK REQUEST BEST PRACTICES

### When Seeking Supervision
• **Specify exactly what you need help with** - don't ask for \"general feedback\"
• **Provide context** - explain what you've tried and where you're stuck
• **Include relevant materials** - attach drafts, outlines, or research notes
• **Set clear expectations** - indicate timeline and next steps
• **Come prepared** - bring specific questions and proposed solutions

### Before Government Contact
• **Complete public research first** - show you've done preliminary work
• **Draft specific questions** - target department expertise
• **Review for professionalism** - separate academic inquiry from advocacy
• **Plan follow-up strategy** - anticipate next steps based on responses
