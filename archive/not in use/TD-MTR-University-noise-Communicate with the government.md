Dear Mr Lee<br>
Referring to the case I wish to point out that the unusually high  level  of  noise  was heard when the train entered and left the  station. Not sure whether your team paid  attention to  noise  level  under such circumstances.</p>
<p>I could send you some audio files if helpful.  MTR  staff cannot be held accountable by Ombudsman so I hope your team can work on this case a bit more.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
